0,"8 Classes Cancelled My boyfriend is in the first year in ON, Canada and his prof has canceled 8 classes this semester...that's four weeks of content that is still going to be on the exam still...is this allowed? I've looked at by-laws but the focus is on students and their academic procedures.    Some of the classes she was in a conference, some she was sick and I understand shit happens, but all of them were canceled with less than 24hrs notice. 2 of the classes, the students were in class and she just never showed up. I'm an upper-year and I have never had a prof cancel more than twice. I just don't think this is professional or okay at all, but he doesn't know what to do.","Response 0: Definitely not okay. You can elevate this to the Office of the Dean of Students and/or the Department head.
Response 1: Not okay. Obviously there may be personal complications but they need to be communicated and the university needs to make alternative arrangements for the provision of teaching. Your boyfriend should see what it says about these situations in his student handbook/contract or whatever.
Response 2: I am an adjunct professor in the US and cancelling that many times is not acceptable at my institution. When instructors cancel class for any reason, they are supposed to make their best effort to find a substitute for the day, and if not, contact the department head to make other arrangements. If absolutely no one can cover for you, then you cancel class, notify students, and post a sign on the door to catch my stragglers. Canceling for any reason should only happen once or twice per semester.   I would agree that he should contact someone like a department head or dean of students. Having that many cancellations is bound to impact his learning in that course and any subsequent courses that rely on knowing that information.
Response 3: 8 is a lot, which is always concerning, but  >2 of the classes, the students were in class and she just never showed up.  this is the biggest, biggest issue imo
Response 4: 8 is a lot, which is always concerning, but  >2 of the classes, the students were in class and she just never showed up.  this is the biggest, biggest issue imo
Response 5: Prof in ON: 8 classes is absurdly, inappropriately high. I try never to plan to cancel more than 3/36hrs per semester (as much as I aim for zero, sometimes it's just not possible with conferences, field work, etc), and replace those with optional workshops so students don't lose out on classroom time.  That said, most institutions don't have strict rules on this... for tenured professors. They do tend to have rules for adjunct/contract faculty.  The easiest recourse here is to express it on the class evaluation. You'll stay 100% anonymous, it will go on their record as a professor, and it's low effort. But, a single evaluation also doesn't have much in the way of odds of changing this.  Another option would be to email your department or program chair. The email should be polite, short, 100% accurate (facts, not feelings/reactions), and to-the-point (e.g., Prof. X canceled 8 classes this semester. They simply no-showed for 2. While I understand things happen, I feel like this interfered with learning goal X and Y. Sorry for having to email you about this, but wanted to let you know.). There's a little more risk here (e.g., you could be 'outed' as the one who did this) so you might choose to do this after the course is over. You could also consider doing this through an anonymous email account if you were concerned about your identity being exposed. Again, though: professional, accurate, and concise.  Finally, you could see what university-wide options exist in terms of an Ombudsman or student advocate. Your student government could help you figure out who to contact. This might allow for an anonymous option.  I'm sorry. That's a really shitty situation and it's not fair of the professor/department. I appreciate your desire to share this so that it's handled appropriately.

1,"Academics taking the piss out of your accent at a conference The title says it really, I recently went to a conference where some of the other PhD students (and their supervisors) thought it was funny to take the piss out of my accent (east london/ essex- I know, I know). I played it off at the time, but it's been bothering me more and more. How are you meant to deal with these kinds of situations (unprofessionalism in a professional setting)?   Theres not much I can do about my accent, and to be honest I really think it's irrelevant so long as what your saying makes sense. I think this is more of a rant than anything, so sorry. Any advice for when this happens again would be great.","Response 0: “Wow, my talk must have been great if all you can comment on is my accent.” “Excuse me, that’s nit very professional, is it?” “Oh, I’m sorry. I didn’t realize you don’t get out much. (University) must be so isolated if my accent is hard for you to understand.”  Don’t start fights, but don’t take crappy behavior either. There’s a lot of meaningless attempted gatekeeping at conferences. I think it’s time we all stopped being doormats for cliquey behavior.
Response 1: I grew up in the US South. Comments are occasionally made, either about my accent or the accent of others. I confront them directly but calmly. I also don't let it go unless there is, I feel, a genuine apology.  I've only had to call someone a carpetbagger once.

Response 4: I found an incredible amount of ""classism"" in the UK when I worked there , but also in the US.  Brian Cox has spoken about this, as has Phil Bland. As someone from a lower-working class background with a pronounced accent,  subjected to the same kind of thing, steam is coming out of ears right now.  This would not be tolerated and would be actionable if they took the piss out of your gender preference, sex or race.  I don't have any advice - (I personally replied with cutting retorts, but I don't recommend that, it is not productive ).    I sometimes have people in the lab or a group that does this, and I pretend I don't get the joke and make them explain it to me so that they can see how mean-spirited and prejudiced it is, but then I am their boss - making someone look a fool (or letting someone who is a fool look a fool in public) is not going to help you either in the very small world we work in.  Sorry for my shitty fellow humans.
Response 5: As a linguist, I seriously lose respect for people who genuinely mock accents, outside light-hearted jokes between friends. I think it is so rude to openly mock someone on their accent or appearance.  If you are having a formal conversation I would simply brush it off with ""Oh, what an unpleasant thing to say to someone"" and move on to the topic at hand. Or you could go with ""I'm genuinely embarrassed you said that"", or ""that's such a socially awkward thing to say.""  You could also go one further and ask ""what does my accent have to do with the subject matter?""  Elitism in academia is incredibly gross, and I would personally recommend calling people out on it where possible.  &#x200B;

Response 13: I find this absolutely bizarre. Maybe it’s because I grew up in a country where we have 11 official languages (South Africa) with easily 5 times the number of accents floating around, but one thing we do NOT do at conferences is negatively comment on accents. Those of academics or the visiting public. I’ve been to 3 conferences in SA and 2 in the UK but have never encountered this. Maybe I’m just bad at spotting that but it seems beyond rude and I can’t think of any academics I know who would do it (out-loud at least). I definitely wouldn’t stand for it and I think you’re well within your rights to call someone out on it. Of course, if it’s just a well-intentioned jest, that’s one thing, but it shouldn’t be happening in the first place I think.
Response 14: As a Frenchman in the UK I can empathise. I was so self-conscious about it that I have done all I can to remove my accent.

Response 40: I can empathise and sympathise but consider that this is a daily occurrence for non-native speakers that speak perfect English. If anything, it is slightly less frequent in academia given how international it is but outside of academia, picking on people's accents becomes even worse.   I am Indian but have more of a BBC accent and I get asked to speak like I ""normally"" do, i.e. an Apu from Simpsons type accent. But at least, I only get this at informal drinks at conferences etc after everyone has had a few drinks. I know my colleagues from China, Latin America and other South Asians with heavier accents have had much worse said to them.

Response 55: As a linguist, I seriously lose respect for people who genuinely mock accents, outside light-hearted jokes between friends. I think it is so rude to openly mock someone on their accent or appearance.  If you are having a formal conversation I would simply brush it off with ""Oh, what an unpleasant thing to say to someone"" and move on to the topic at hand. Or you could go with ""I'm genuinely embarrassed you said that"", or ""that's such a socially awkward thing to say.""  You could also go one further and ask ""what does my accent have to do with the subject matter?""  Elitism in academia is incredibly gross, and I would personally recommend calling people out on it where possible.  &#x200B;

Response 57: I found an incredible amount of ""classism"" in the UK when I worked there , but also in the US.  Brian Cox has spoken about this, as has Phil Bland. As someone from a lower-working class background with a pronounced accent,  subjected to the same kind of thing, steam is coming out of ears right now.  This would not be tolerated and would be actionable if they took the piss out of your gender preference, sex or race.  I don't have any advice - (I personally replied with cutting retorts, but I don't recommend that, it is not productive ).    I sometimes have people in the lab or a group that does this, and I pretend I don't get the joke and make them explain it to me so that they can see how mean-spirited and prejudiced it is, but then I am their boss - making someone look a fool (or letting someone who is a fool look a fool in public) is not going to help you either in the very small world we work in.  Sorry for my shitty fellow humans.

Response 63: I'd be tempted to tell them to get fucked. Or publicly call them out on their ridiculous behaviour.

Response 80: I find this absolutely bizarre. Maybe it’s because I grew up in a country where we have 11 official languages (South Africa) with easily 5 times the number of accents floating around, but one thing we do NOT do at conferences is negatively comment on accents. Those of academics or the visiting public. I’ve been to 3 conferences in SA and 2 in the UK but have never encountered this. Maybe I’m just bad at spotting that but it seems beyond rude and I can’t think of any academics I know who would do it (out-loud at least). I definitely wouldn’t stand for it and I think you’re well within your rights to call someone out on it. Of course, if it’s just a well-intentioned jest, that’s one thing, but it shouldn’t be happening in the first place I think.

Response 83: I recall meeting several scots at LIGO in LA. They're some of the most professional, passionate and intelligent scientists I've met. Their accents did not hamper them, so maybe try to locate some of them and ask for advice. (Sorry, it was a brief visit so I've lost their names.)  I'm Norwegian myself, but I've never had anyone question my accent. I was picked on for my Norwegian dialect by other Norwegians growing up, but in retrospect I realise I was my own worst enemy when I let the teasing get to me.   As adults you'd never expect to hear this in a professional setting.   There are a few ways to deal with it, but they all depend on the group you're in and the person making fun of you.   1) Call them out.   Redirect the attention to their behaviour instead of your accent:  Don't say anything. Give them your full attention as if you're waiting for the punchline to their remark. It'll get awkward for them fast.   This gives them the opportunity to revert their former statement. They could say something like; 'I'm just messing with you. Your accent is great. Please, carry on, I'd like to hear more.""    If they don't take the hint, put words to how you feel. Say something like ""I'm sorry, I'm just reliving my childhood trauma of being teased for my accent"" Say it with a smile; if you can evoke laughter and sympathy you can win anyone over.   Always give people a way out when they behave badly. It might be they didn't mean to at all.   2) Take them aside later and express how you feel.    3) Own it. (I recommend this one.)   In the words of Tyrion Lannister;  *Never forget what you are, the rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor and it can never be used to hurt you.*  Make your accent a part of your brand and be proud of it. If it's a class thing, make a quip about how you're trying to defy stereotypes within academia.    Honestly; watching Jim from The Office made me realise that it's not my accent that was the problem; I was simply surrounded by really mean, insecure people from time to time.  Either way; good luck! :-)

2,"Advice on improving Academic Writing! I'm trying to form a habit to practice academic writing regularly. My experience so far has taught me that I need to focus on following things:  1. Grammar 2. Critical Thinking:to form sound arguments and synthesize material  3. Overcoming procrastination: because I'm absolutely terrified of writing.    I'm brushing up grammar and studying about critical thinking through MOOC courses. (I can link it up in the comments, if anyone is interested). However I've come to realization that I need to practice alongside learning all this. If not, this goal will easily take a backseat for me.   Presently I'm trying to follow Patricia Goodson's Becoming an Academic Writer. (I also intend on going though books by Paul Silivia and Helen Sword)   What I need help with:   1. I'm confused about what to tackle during these exercises (for example, setting aside time daily for writing). Should I work on some specific project or take on any random topic that comes to my mind?   2. What other aspects of writing and practice  should I focus on?    (About me: I'm a psychology undergraduate, looking forward to start MSc in Clinical Psychology. English is not my first language)","Response 0: There is no substitution for reading and writing more. Do more of it. You can start by writing down your experiment plan as if it were a paper's Materials and Methods. Then to the Results and so on. Make your lit. Review into introductions and so on.
Response 1: I disagree with those saying you only need to write and practice. Practice *is* important, but not without critically thinking about what works and what doesn't in your writing. It's difficult to evaluate your own text, but I found that reading other books helped me criticize (and therefore improve) my work.  These are the books I've read so far during my PhD. Pick and choose whichever you feel will help you most:  * On Writing Well (Zinsser): general help, not related to academia, to improve how you write * Oxford Guide to Plain English (Cutts): how to communicate your ideas clearly in simple language * Storytelling with Data (Nussbaumer Knaflic): how to use visualizations right * Stylish Academic Writing (Sword): how to write with style (personally I found this book overrated) * The Craft of Scientific Writing (Alley): general tips to scientific writing * The Elements of Style (Strunk Jr.): how to use words right, with a focus on grammar and basics (excellent book, albeit a heavy read at times) * They Say I Say (Graff and Birkenstein): how to set up an argument in scientific writing

Response 4: The one thing not mentioned so far is feedback. It needs to be fairly brutal and ideally fairly immediate. It can be a little tough to find someone to give such feedback but it's worth its weight in gold.  To supplement the feedback, another thing you can do is go and find something you wrote a while ago, and rewrite it/assess it as if it were someone else's work.

Response 6: I love Richard Lanham’s Revising Prose. Biggest problem I see with upper-level and graduate students is a lack of clarity in their writing. Long, bulky, verbal-filled subjects for their sentences, with a weak verb, and long, bulky, verbal-filled objects. As a reader/supervisor, I often have to work really hard to understand these sentences. Students will think, often, that I’m trying to stifle their creativity, or I just don’t get their complex ideas. But the problem is a total lack of clarity in their writing. If your ideas are strong, I should be thinking through and grappling with the concepts, not with the sentences.
Response 7: I'm a sociology undergrad and what I do to improve this skill is to read an old academic paper ( often on which many new theories are formulated) and write a summary from my perspective ensuring 0% plagiarism.  I've found this exercise to improve critical thinking and creative writing.

Response 9: > I'm confused about what to tackle during these exercises (for example, setting aside time daily for writing). Should I work on some specific project or take on any random topic that comes to my mind?   These books are aimed at grad students and professors in my experience, so they assume you have some kind of ongoing project you are working on. I think for you what could be good is to take stuff you *have* written, for a class or whatever, and work on revising it.  What is tricky, I think, is that writing is all about context and expectations. Grad students and professors are ultimately writing toward publication, and should ultimately have specific venues in mind. They can study how to write well by looking at examples of good writing of the sort they want to write. If you are an undergrad, I am not sure what your writing goal would be other than to get good grades-- but I think having one would help.  I thought Paul Silvia's book was kind of dumb, fwiw. The key to writing a lot turns out to be, uh, writing a lot. Felt like an essay that was fluffed up to be short book.

Response 20: The most difficult part of academic writing is actually explaining to the reader why your text is the way it is, i.e. arguing for your particular way of presenting your sources and thoughts. Here's how I usually teach academic writing to undergrads:  First, decide on a *theme*, a type of theoretic categorization that allows you to set up the framework for your text. A tentative title might be useful for this.  Second, find sources that fit your theme. You might have to reconsider your theme after this step.  Third, make it painfully clear both in thinking and in writing why those sources fit your theme. This is the difficult part.  Fourth, turn this into a coherent text where you describe the theme, the contents of your sources and why it all fits together. Write your main part and conclusion.  Fifth, write a snappy and intelligent introduction.

Response 30: Your points are fine, but you should think of them in this order:  1.  Overcoming procrastination   2.  Critical Thinking:to form sound arguments and synthesize material  3.  Grammar      If you do not overcome (1), (2) and (3) do not matter.  If you cannot sort out (2), the best grammar in the world will not help you.  One of the man flaws in academic writing is the use of redundant words.  The key is to edit, edit, edit - and then edit once more.  Ask yourself ""do I need this word"".  If you do not, cut it.  The overarching principle in writing is to start by asking yourself ""What do I want to say?"", and finishing with ""have I said it?"".

Response 38: There are some very nice recommendation above. Here is my two cents:  1. The Elements of Style is a short and concise book on how to improve your writing. I believe it is considered a standard.  2. Daily exercises do improve your writing. I am assuming that you are actively involved in research as a M.Sc. student, in which case a personal research journal is a great excuse to write every day. Try to keep it as formal (but simple) as you can. It helps to imagine that you are writing an article. You want your writing to be clear but not casual. That way you will be forced to polish your arguments and conclusions, and tie any loose ends, on a daily basis. It will also help you digest your own research while the outcome will constitute prose that can be transferred directly to a publishable scientific paper.  I hope this helps.

Response 41: You need to write alongside a good writer -- edit and criticize manuscripts together.  Your mentor will tell you why your outline is trash because it does not flow logically; why each of your sentences make no sense and are ungrammatical; and why the words you choose are basic or invalid! You are trying to standardize it way too much -- writing is not a Science, you just have to write, then re-write, and have multiple audiences read your writing. Eventually you will have the audience's perspective in your mind and you will become a great writer!

Response 78: > I'm confused about what to tackle during these exercises (for example, setting aside time daily for writing). Should I work on some specific project or take on any random topic that comes to my mind?  While you're getting some great advice from other posters, I wanted to stress here that _the act of writing anything, at all_, can be a good practice to get in the habit of doing regularly. There's a lot to be said for feeling comfortable sitting down and writing--for many just sitting at a keyboard can cause considerable anxiety.   > What other aspects of writing and practice should I focus on?  How much academic writing in your field are you regularly reading? What kinds of arguments are you being asked to develop in your writing? It can be a valuable practice to get more familiar with the genres you're expected to engage in. Think about what the authors of a given text are doing in their work: how do they make an argument? how is it supported? how is it structured/organized? what kinds of discussion occurs re: included data, evidence, etc.? and so on. This awareness can help you approach writing your own documents that much more effectively, since you'll make better-informed decisions when you do so.

I'm brushing up grammar and studying about critical thinking through MOOC courses. (I can link it up in the comments, if anyone is interested).

My PhD advisor has decided that my work should be a communication instead of a full paper very last minute. The work is definitely enough for a full paper (5-7 figures, work is novel, multiple experiments), so I don’t really understand his rationale. This is my first, first-author manuscript and I’m just a little disappointed. Can anyone share their perspective on a decision like this? Will a communication look worse on my CV?","Response 0: I'm not sure why you're disappointed - a communication is just a slightly shorter article. As long as it still contains all of the information and data you want to share, there is really no difference. Communications are not viewed as inferior to full papers, so I really wouldn't worry about it. If you are concerned or confused, just ask your advisor what caused their change of mind.

Response 3: What field is this? I don’t know what a communication is. Is it like a brief report? Still peer reviewed?
Response 4: Hmm- depends on the field.  Typically communications get published faster and get a little more visibility.   Also you can usually follow it up with a longer paper later if you get more data or a new analysis.    If you’re worried about needing those figures for context - you can include them in supplemental materials.    Unless you have some other reasons to worry about them, I would say trust your advisor
Response 5: Where he/she aiming to publish it?  If its a communication in Nature/Science etc. then that's much better [for you and your career] than a full paper elsewhere.

Response 7: I can’t see an issue with this. At least in my field, most novel work from a group gets published first as a communication, then followed up with a full paper.   The communication gets more press, is published faster so there’s less chance of being scooped, and then the full paper gets more eyes because people have been waiting for it.

Response 9: As long as you feel that making it shorter won’t force you to cut out important information, you’re probably better off with a communication. It makes no difference on your CV—a pub is a pub, the bar for getting a communication published is lower typically (and that’s not a bad thing—a lot of higher tier journals reject 90% of submissions right off the bat), and shorter papers are generally more highly cited because it’s less for people to read. There may be some field dependent differences here (I’m a psych researcher), but in my experience this typically has more pros than cons!!  TL;DR: communications looks the same on a CV, is more likely to get an R&R, & will be more highly cited

Response 15: I think it’s important to consider what your experience in having papers accepted is and also what their track record with communications/letters are. As such, I would recommend students have several letter style papers as it looks the same on a CV while probably being (relatively) easier to present on account of length while also benefiting the scientific community without publishing yet excessively verbose paper (a bane of science).  As someone above said; if you really want to dig further, then ask your advisor. Learning to understand someone else and then making your case is always a good quality/ability to develop. But do not argue for the sake of argument. :-)

Response 31: Also, don't discount the strong possibility that submitting a full article to a really high impact factor journal will be rejected.  Preparing multiple (re)submissions only to get a rejection, as most high IF submissions end up, is not a good use of time. Some of my PhD friends and their advisors have gone for high IF submissions. It usually ends in 6-12 months of sunk costs, unless it is an objectively awesome and novel paper.  Also, I haven't noticed substantial differences in credit between submitting a short report vs. a full article. In some fields, a full article needs a hell of a lot more work for a very low return-on-investment.  If you get a Nature, Science, Cell, or NEJM article, then great. Otherwise, there are the top-, mid-, and low-tier journals below them.

4,"Are there any people on here who had to leave academia because of a chronic illness that affects their memory/energy? Towards the end of grad school, the stress of writing my dissertation caused me to develop a very debilitating chronic illness.  Since then, I have struggled to find employment.  I can use my mind for anything difficult for maybe 2-4 hours a day.  It has been almost three years and I have yet to find a treatment that makes my illness manageable for full time work. I'm struggling very much financially and need something better than the crappy hourly work I have now.  I've been trying to get a post doc because it would give me a flexible schedule to focus on my health (I'm an anthropologist and am able to have a flexible schedule). The problem is, I'm just not well enough to work on publications so I'm not an attractive candidate for any decent paying fellowships. I've thought about consulting, but my big concern is not having decent health insurance.  I'm worried that any increase in income from consulting would be wiped out by medical bills.  Has anybody been in my shoes and figured out a solution to getting part time work (or full time work that can be done part time by someone highly qualified) that offers insurance and good pay.  I cannot work on my feet for long periods of time.  Any recommendations would be welcome.","Response 0: I don't have practical advice because my condition was resolvable, but I wanted to let you know you're not alone in this.  I thought I had garden variety burnout when I finished my PhD - and I did - but it turned out it was also Graves' disease, a pretty serious if untreated thyroid condition that didn't get diagnosed until five years later.  It screwed my mental health, my energy, and my focus, and possibly had been doing so for most of my life.  What worked for me, both while I was being crushed under it and while I was getting diagnosed and treated, was taking a government administration job. Fixed pay scales, flexible hours, good union, excellent sick pay, and although most of the work was very boring it was usually not very difficult or stressful. I'm not from the US but some of these things are transferable to most city/state/federal civil/public service positions. They're stable, they're boring, and they attract people who need stability more than challenge or opportunity.  I wasn't very happy in it, and I'm planning to leave, but it's what kept me financially solvent, independent, and with a respectable resume for five years. Maybe look into open recruitment for those positions where you are? In many cases just having a degree is enough to be considered.
Response 1: Your story is similar to mine, but different with respect to your overall physical and/or mental health. I would be willing to talk about this with you further, my health issues stemmed from a lack of support and absolute unprofessionalism that essentially made me want to quit. I should’ve received my PhD over a year ago, But the lack of emotional and mental support - The absolute lies and deplorable unprofessional environment, creates this feeling of hostility, and led to a series of physical and mental illnesses that followed for me as well.  I certainly have  panic attacks writing manuscripts lost on how to finish my dissertation, because I don’t trust the person who tossed me out of the way; this mentor essentially published a paper that I wrote without acknowledging me. Departmental academics and absolute gaslighting and selfishness of this mentor has done more damage that I can see myself coping with.  So, while I’m so close to finishing, I’m actually considering quitting the PhD. It’s shattered my mental health my physical health and I’ve sacrificed everything in my life, Because I thought it would “get better”.  I don’t have support, academically, their family, a few friends I do… But if you have a network that you can speak with, reach out to, and figure out the best way that you can succeed… Or even develop coping plan with what you are experiencing right now, your health is the most important thing. Some people might make you feel guilty for that, but you are more important. I know my story isn’t aligned with yours, But I feel like I can relate to your pain. I want to start speaking with the trusted people within your department and college and health services if possible, and those you trust To let them know what is going on with you. You are your advocate here. You plenty of people that support you, and I wish you the best of luck!

6,"Cambridge undergrad is 6 months of term time a year with bachelors in 3 years, leading US universities is 8 months of term time a year with bachelors in 4 years. Why is there such a big disparity - is the Cambridge course really that condensed or do you learn more in a US degree?","Response 0: Ok, so my undergraduate and masters were both from Cambridge and I did an exchange at MIT so I may be able to help out somewhat. In a word, yes, they are pretty comparable.   When you go to Cambridge you attend a college within the university. Each of these colleges competes to gain the highest number of 'good degrees' each year and as such most of the teaching is done by the college itself. These take the form of supervisions (supos) which are often one on one, or one on three perhaps, in which you talk about a specific topic then submit an essay or work sheet every week. This means that for some subjects you are literally writing around 4,000 words per week. On top of this you have lectures (which not everyone attends) laid on by the university. Coupled with extra curricular work, sports and the like you really have very little time to do anything while in term time. That said, terms are short at only 8 weeks.   It's quite a bit more work than MIT, but that said there is much more downtime outside of term, whereas at MIT there was time to have fun during the semester.   Something else which is fairly unique is the way the degree works, the tripos. For some subjects you actually don't have any exams that count for anything until your third year. So you basically have to revise everything you have learnt for finals. This doesn't apply to everything though, some courses take account of every year. Supposedly engineers only need a first in one of the years of their tripos to quality (apparently), although for the Tompkins table I am fairly certain only 3rd and 2nd year results are used.

Response 2: 8-week terms are so short that most students spend at least half of the ""month off"" you get at Christmas and Easter revising and consolidating what they were supposed to learn that term. It's a jam-packed 8 weeks. I'm not sure what the ""more time for reading before final exams"" is about, I don't think I ever had more than about ten days between lectures/projects finishing and exams starting, at Cambridge. Not a lot of time to revise a year's worth of work.
Response 3: The difference is probably in the 'general education' requirements. Technically, they are meant to broaden the students' horizons and teach them about fields outside of their own specialty. In reality, they're fucking GPA boosters for most students. Like many things in an old system, what used to be useful has outlived its purpose.

7,"Colleague forcing their way onto my manuscript ... I think? Hi all,  I wrote a manuscript for the work I've done in the past year or so. I relied on some data generated by a previous student, so myself, him, and our PI are the only authors on the manuscript. My PI suggested that I send it to this 2nd author for review/editing/comments, and then a couple of other colleagues in the lab for internal review before the PI reads it himself.  The first round goes great and my 2nd author returns great comments after a week worth of 2 back and forth. I proceed to send it to the next person, who's a post-doc turned research associate - too long of a tenure as a post-doc, he had to switch to being an RA. I get my comments back from the RA and I see that he has added himself as an author on my paper. I looked through the document and the comments/edits he's suggesting aren't any better/more thorough than what my 2nd author did. Mostly grammar/language and ""cite this please"" sort of commentary. I never discussed adding him as another author on my paper and I wasn't aware he was going to do it. From going through the document several times, I am also likely going to reject many of the edits as I don't think he fully grasped my paper and some of the comments are more confusing than helpful.  I haven't told my PI yet and I'm unsure if he has looked at the document. From my personal knowledge, this being my first first-author manuscript, a person has to provide data for a figure or provide some extensive technical skill (bioinformatics, surgery) to receive authorship ... though I know this is also journal-dependent. I've reviewed/edited manuscripts from colleagues and other people on the floor before and never asked nor was offered to be an author. I am a 2nd, 3rd, and 4th author on several papers and for all of them I personally did work and provided data for a figure or several to guarantee authorship.  Is this normal to grant authorship to somebody because they reviewed/edited a manuscript during internal review? Especially when this wasn't discussed before and the reviewer in question simply put their name on the manuscript without consent.","Response 0: Talk to your PI! Probably a miscommunication, which your PI can help smooth over and could take an opportunity to talk the RA and make sure their understanding of how authorship works is reasonable. If I was an author of every paper I provided comments on, I'd be tenured already.  In my experience this would not constitute authorship because they did not provide a substantial intellectual contribution. It also may literally not constitute authorship to whatever journal you are submitting to. Your PI should take care of this and/or provide you advice.
Response 1: Sounds like a miscommunication to me. When he received the manuscript he assumed it was because he was being included as an author, so he added his name and affiliation to be helpful.  Or he knows this wasn't the intention but is trying to be shady and sneak onto the paper. That's the more pessimistic view, I guess.  Either way, talk to your PI ASAP about how to have this conversation with the guy diplomatically.
Response 2: I would tell the PI, it's their job to set this straight with the post-doc. For most journals this level of contribution would be against their rules for authorship.   &#x200B;  And now you know for the future - when you ask for internal review, just make very clear when asking that it would be a favour and not warrant authorship.

Response 4: Yeah no. This isn’t amateur hour. Get this idiot off the author list ASAP, and inform the PI of the situation so it doesn’t happen again.
Response 5: Yeah no. This isn’t amateur hour. Get this idiot off the author list ASAP, and inform the PI of the situation so it doesn’t happen again.
Response 6: This is why labs need clear guidelines established by the PI as to what merits authorship. In some disciplines there are also published guidelines laying out explicitly which activities can or should result in being a named author on a paper.
Response 7: couldn’t you just remove his name as subtly as he added it?

8,"Dealing with student haggling for grades I'll admit, I'm relatively new to the profession (yay, pun, moving on), but I am increasingly (in a relatively short term) seeing emails from students after grades are posted hoping to bargain for an increased grade. They use lots of strategies, but the overall bent is always ""won't you reconsider my grade due to these special circumstances?"" My consistent response is that they have been subjected to the same grading criteria as all other students in the class, and I haven't had any blowback from that (although it is something that raises my general concern level, mainly the possibility of a substantial amount of unnecessary work on my part if a grade is disputed).  Those who've been in the game longer, do you notice a similar trend in increased requests to increase final grades? Any suggestions on preempting this wave of nagging?","Response 0: While not a professor, I have been teaching 2-3 classes per semester for the past 3.5 years.  I get these sorts of emails every semester, usually from <5% of my students.  One strategy that I've employed is to try to minimize the amount of time between when I enter their final grades online (where they can see them) and when I assign final grades in our schools online portal (where they are final).  Usually I'll enter final exam grades late one afternoon, sleep on it, look it over in the morning, and then submit my final grades to the university.  This gives them less time to haggle as they know (at least at my institution), that it's difficult to change once they've been officially submitted to the university.  The other strategy I've employed is emailing them as soon as final exam grades are entered, to a.) let me know grades are posted and b.) remind them that their grade is final and there is nothing they can do at this point to change their grade.  These things helped me go from getting these emails from 10% of my class to getting them from <5%.  Your mileage may vary.
Response 1: I'm not a professor, but I think you're on the right track. The fact that your students don't try to haggle with you after your first response is the proof in the pudding.
","{'solution': 'To address the issue of students haggling for higher grades, it is essential to establish clear, consistent grading criteria upfront. This transparency can help students understand expectations and reduce the need for disputes. Regular feedback sessions and structured review processes allow students to track their progress and improve.

Additionally, clear communication of grading policies, such as using a detailed grading rubric and providing constructive feedback, can foster a respectful academic environment where students feel their efforts are valued.

9,"Discouraged Phd applicant on where to go from here. I got rejected from basically all of the Clinical Psychology Phd programs that I applied to. I am immensely interested in researching mental health/developmental disorders, as well as malignant brain development due to environmental stressors/trauma within marginalized communities. I have more specific research interests that I expressed in my personal statement as well, that I believe aligned with advisors I wanted to work with. I didn't apply to that many because I couldn't afford it and didn't qualify for the income waiver either that typically requires below poverty level indication.   I've been trying to find full-time research positions since I graduated in 2019 with a B.A. in Psychology from a small university and I have been applying to a variety of full-time research assistant/coordinator/manager positions (*all around the U.S.*) since I graduated and have only gotten rejections and no interviews, even for positions I was clearly qualified for. The people that I've known to get these type of positions always have had some kind of connection from the inside to get in, which I do not. I ended up taking a full-time management job in the private sector, whilst volunteering in a research lab part time (*this lab does not have any full time positions*).  I feel very stuck and discouraged especially as a BIPOC person, it seems like gatekeeping runs very deep in academia and full-time research/PhD opportunities for Psychology and Neuroscience are incredibly slim.   Any advice on the next steps I should take to increase my chances of getting into a PhD next cycle? I would also be open to applying to Cog Neuro Phd programs as well.   Thanks!","Response 0: Might be different in the states, but what about PsyD and Counselling Psychology as alternatives? I'm hearing your research interests perhaps more closely align with clinical, but the overlap between counselling and clinical is increasing every year imo.  But at the heart of all this, this sucks. I'm sorry to hear the application process wasn't what you were hoping for. It's absolutely normal and terrifyingly common, but it still, wholeheartedly, sucks.

Response 2: FWIW, in my experience lab managers are not an entry-level position necessarily.  It’s something you’d get promoted to from a lab tech starting point.  Did you do any research in undergrad?  What does the PI of the research lab you are currently volunteering in have to say about your application results?  Or your other letter writers?
Response 3: One piece of advice I got when I was applying to programs was that you shouldn’t take an initial rejection as a “no,” but as a “not yet.” A lot of programs limit how many grad students can have the same advisor in each cycle. So your interests aligning with professors is more helpful when others don’t. It’s impossible to guess how those things will shake out before each application cycle is over, so I’d say not to take that as a sign that those people don’t ever want to work with you. I’m really sorry you got such frustrating news during this already hard year, but things could go very differently next year.

Response 6: I'm in a department with a top-20 clinical psych program and we're disgustingly competitive even in a normal year (900 applicants for 9 spots). One of the girls in my year graduated with like a 4.0 from Harvard and still took 2 years off for a postbacc. This year they definitely had more applicants maybe like 50% more for the same number of spots. Neuroscience too has around 500 applicants to 10-15 spots and they probably also had a similar percent increase in the number of applicants.  What I'm saying is don't feel bad if you didn't make it anywhere this year (or any year in general). A postbacc is the norm these days but if this is something you truly want to do, it's not a big deal. I took four years off and I don't regret a second of it. It made me an enormously better neuroscientist and sometimes I think even 5 or 6 years off would've been better.

Response 18: You say you “believe” that your interests aligned with potential advisors. Had you been in touch with them before you applied? Taking on a PhD student is a big commitment for a professor—bigger that I think most students realize—so they might not want to risk admitting an unknown quantity, especially if they already had potential students lined up and couldn’t take on more than a certain number.  If you apply for the next cycle, I’d strongly encourage you to drop a line to potential advisors first to introduce yourself. Say you’re applying and you’d like to work with them in particular because [specific reasons]. (Don’t spam out generalities to everyone; those emails get trashed right away.) Ask if they are taking on PhD students. Good luck!
Response 19: Possibly unpopular opinion: it's never too early to say fuck it and close that page.

Response 20: Yea, clinical psychology programs are insanely competitive. Are you interested more in being a therapist, or the biological side of neuro dev disorders?
Response 21: I'm not sure your educational background, but if you're from a smaller, teaching focused undergrad (like a SLAC), it may be more difficult to break into a PhD program directly because faculty may not know the quality of your education, especially if the psych dept faculty don't contribute scholarship to clinical fields. If that's the case your best option could be to apply to Masters programs in clinical psychology (occupational therapy, neuroscience or cognitive psych programs could also be good options, but I prefer recommending OT/clinical programs as they have good back up careers outside of academia), preferably competitive, research programs. Masters programs are generally more willing to give ""unknown applicants"" chances and it will give you an opportunity to complete research and ""prove"" you can make it at the next level. It will probably lead to additional student loan debt and it likely won't lead to earlier completion of a PhD (most masters degrees don't transfer to PhD), but if you are determined to get your PhD it could help.

Response 26: I know it's discouraging, but what you're experiencing is something that just about everyone in applied psychology has gone through. There are so many huge competitions during training (graduate school admission is the biggest one, funding applications are next, getting papers published, internship applications, post-doc applications...) that just about everyone had had at least one major rejection. Most applicants to clinical psychology apply a few times before they get in. It's tough to deal with and just anxiety provoking to think about, but know that it's not you and that this is pretty normal.

There are so many huge competitions during training (graduate school admission is the biggest one, funding applications are next, getting papers published, internship applications, post-doc applications...) that just about everyone had had at least one major rejection. Most applicants to clinical psychology apply a few times before they get in. It's tough to deal with and just anxiety provoking to think about, but know that it's not you and that this is pretty normal.

Response 37: You say you “believe” that your interests aligned with potential advisors. Had you been in touch with them before you applied? Taking on a PhD student is a big commitment for a professor—bigger that I think most students realize—so they might not want to risk admitting an unknown quantity, especially if they already had potential students lined up and couldn’t take on more than a certain number.  If you apply for the next cycle, I’d strongly encourage you to drop a line to potential advisors first to introduce yourself. Say you’re applying and you’d like to work with them in particular because [specific reasons]. (Don’t spam out generalities to everyone; those emails get trashed right away.) Ask if they are taking on PhD students. Good luck!
Response 38: I was rejected my first round of applications to clinical psychology PhD programs as well. I found a fully funded master’s program (tuition + stipend) and it was the best decision I ever made. It really enhanced my application and I got two offers when I applied again two years later. My PhD program also accepted my master’s thesis, so I was able to go right into my dissertation. Highly recommend if you can find a funded master’s option (they’re rare but out there!)
Response 39: I know there’s a lot of comments, but hopefully you see this. There’s this program called PREP funded by the NIH. It’s specifically for people of color who want to get their PhD. It’s a postbac program that’s runs a year, u get paid a livable salary to work in a research lab, and u get professional development and guidance as you apply to grad school. I applied to PRPE, got in, and I got into a few counseling psychology programs. I didn’t apply to any clinical programs but I got interviews/acceptances at pretty competitive programs.
Response 40: I have students who are completing clinical masters programs with multiple publications including one first authored publication and many posters who are not getting accepted anywhere. You don’t mention having publications or posters, and if you don’t, that is probably your biggest issue. Consider a Masters program.

Response 44: I graduated with my BA in psych in 2018 and just started a lab position. It’s not entry level, and also I had lots of experience in CMH that they found very valuable. So in my case it wasn’t connections but specific experience.   Obviously the pandemic has really messed with academic research. We aren’t recruiting for our study yet and we have accepted that things will continue to stall for a bit, and I don’t think there’s room for another doctoral student in our lab. Although most PhD programs don’t really care about a masters (as in it doesn’t save you time in a doctoral program) doing a masters or MPS in clinical psych can help you get to know professors and get into a lab, which could be the connection you need to get into a good doctoral program.
Response 45: If this is going to make you feel any better, as a PhD nearing graduation (which is akin to Zeno's Arrow Paradox),     > Discouraged Phd applicant on where to go from here  sounds better than,  > Depressed PhD graduate on where to go from here  Maybe it's a good thing that you are forced to do something alternative. You can always regain your strength and apply back a few years later.
Response 46: If you’re open to neuro PhDs, I would argue that’s a better route. This is based on comparing my experiences as a STEM PhD to the experiences of friends (and my psychologist) who have done PhDs in clinical psych. First, clinical psych does require working as a lab manager first, and that does seem to require having an “in”. Second, clinical psych is often a 7-10 year program, but a neuro PhD is 5-6. Third, as a BIPOC researching “hard” science (neuro) you have tons of exclusive opportunities for fellowships and grants. While this may be somewhat true in all disciplines, medically-relevant “hard” science has the most funding opportunities overall. Finally, PhDs in medical colleges have higher pay and fewer outside requirements (e.g. TA ships) compared to basically all other PhDs. The drawback of a neuro PhD is that it might be harder to work on the developmental effects of growing up in a marginalized community, but you can definitely find neuro opportunities in developmental disorders or mental health.  One last thing... Department’s admissions have been affected in a variety of ways due to the pandemic. If you decide to look into neuro PhD programs, you should look around to see if any you are interested in are still allowing applications.
Response 47: What are you stats? GPA GRE publication etc.

Response 50: One thing to keep in mind is that the current environment is incredibly *atypical*  because of the covid-19 pandemic. There are many programs in many disciplines that have simply suspended their normal intakes of graduate students, especially programs where there is simply no way to avoid having people in close physical proximity together in the course of doing professional training and research. So you need to not come to any fixed or final view of your qualifications or chances of admission under more normal circumstances, which hopefully will come back into view in the 2022-23 academic year (and thus will influence applications this coming fall).   However, if you want to look carefully to see if there's any issues in your applications that you can improve on before the next application cycle, the very best thing you could do is to show your applications from this year to a trusted undergraduate professor that you worked with--and if you had any peers or friends who were majors in Psychology at your university alongside you, show them too.   The other thing to keep in mind is even if it's true that the jobs you applied for were ones you were qualified for and should have been considered for, keep in mind that the atypicality of this year applies to those applications, at least since March 2020. It may well be true that many of those opportunities have gone to people who were known to the people running the lab as well, but you have to find a place to put your legitimate frustration and anger with that possibility out of mind temporarily while you are working on your applications--it can affect how you present yourself and your candidacy in ways that you might not pick up on.
Response 51: First, this was an incredibly competitive cycle, with more applicants and fewer slots. Hopefully next year or two years from now will be better. Clinical psych programs are also very competitive, and I'm hearing moreso this year. If you want to go research, look more into non-clinical programs, which it sounds like you are doing with Cog neuro programs. This area can fall into different programs including neuroscience and psychology, so look broadly.   For RA positions, applying across the country might actually be hurting you. For some reason, I've known a few people who like to hire RAs that would not be moving. Their rationale is they want them to be likely to accept the job, and many of these jobs have a probationary period and people don't want someone to move across the country and then lose their job after 3 months. Not saying this is the right reasoning at all, but there is a chance your application is getting tossed when they see you live far away.   Do you have any mentors or profs you were close with at your undergrad institution? They might be able to help you network. Otherwise, sadly, the level of competition is stiff. Try to get on papers and posters. I actually value an undergrad who presented their own poster, even if at a local school event, over an undergrad who probably just got lucky to be a middle author on a paper they didn't lead. Look for diversity fellowships. There are lots of them and I encourage you to contact future PIs and tell them you'd like to apply to fellowships. If you are free, you are hard to turn down! Look at the conferences in. your field, many have diversity scholarships that would pay you to go to the conference- great networking and an award to put on the CV. Best of luck!
Response 52: One piece of advice I got when I was applying to programs was that you shouldn’t take an initial rejection as a “no,” but as a “not yet.” A lot of programs limit how many grad students can have the same advisor in each cycle. So your interests aligning with professors is more helpful when others don’t. It’s impossible to guess how those things will shake out before each application cycle is over, so I’d say not to take that as a sign that those people don’t ever want to work with you. I’m really sorry you got such frustrating news during this already hard year, but things could go very differently next year.
Response 53: Yea, clinical psychology programs are insanely competitive. Are you interested more in being a therapist, or the biological side of neuro dev disorders?
Response 54: Might be different in the states, but what about PsyD and Counselling Psychology as alternatives? I'm hearing your research interests perhaps more closely align with clinical, but the overlap between counselling and clinical is increasing every year imo.  But at the heart of all this, this sucks. I'm sorry to hear the application process wasn't what you were hoping for. It's absolutely normal and terrifyingly common, but it still, wholeheartedly, sucks.
Response 55: You say you “believe” that your interests aligned with potential advisors. Had you been in touch with them before you applied? Taking on a PhD student is a big commitment for a professor—bigger that I think most students realize—so they might not want to risk admitting an unknown quantity, especially if they already had potential students lined up and couldn’t take on more than a certain number.

Response 56: FWIW, in my experience lab managers are not an entry-level position necessarily.  It’s something you’d get promoted to from a lab tech starting point.  Did you do any research in undergrad?  What does the PI of the research lab you are currently volunteering in have to say about your application results?  Or your other letter writers?
Response 57: I'm in a department with a top-20 clinical psych program and we're disgustingly competitive even in a normal year (900 applicants for 9 spots). One of the girls in my year graduated with like a 4.0 from Harvard and still took 2 years off for a postbacc. This year they definitely had more applicants maybe like 50% more for the same number of spots. Neuroscience too has around 500 applicants to 10-15 spots and they probably also had a similar percent increase in the number of applicants.  What I'm saying is don't feel bad if you didn't make it anywhere this year (or any year in general). A postbacc is the norm these days but if this is something you truly want to do, it's not a big deal. I took four years off and I don't regret a second of it. It made me an enormously better neuroscientist and sometimes I think even 5 or 6 years off would've been better.
Response 58: Possibly unpopular opinion: it's never too early to say fuck it and close that page. At the end of the day this is just a job, and if it's this hard and this demoralizing and makes you feel less-than because of your race - fuck it. It's not worth it. You got a job, and what sounds like a good job with progression potential, so maybe just leave this thing that you've been working at all this time to no avail well enough alone. Sometimes it's good to move mountains, but sometimes it's good to grow where you're planted.
Response 59: I am sorry to hear this. Know that Phd in clinical psych is extremely competitive. I know a lot of people who didn't get in with at least 2 attempts. What are your credentials like (e.g., years of research experience, number of poster presentations, number of publications, standardized test scores)? Maybe I can comment on it better. Feel free to pm me! Don't lose hope, you will get in eventually!
Response 60: I'm not sure your educational background, but if you're from a smaller, teaching focused undergrad (like a SLAC), it may be more difficult to break into a PhD program directly because faculty may not know the quality of your education, especially if the psych dept faculty don't contribute scholarship to clinical fields. If that's the case your best option could be to apply to Masters programs in clinical psychology (occupational therapy, neuroscience or cognitive psych programs could also be good options, but I prefer recommending OT/clinical programs as they have good back up careers outside of academia), preferably competitive, research programs. Masters programs are generally more willing to give ""unknown applicants"" chances and it will give you an opportunity to complete research and ""prove"" you can make it at the next level. It will probably lead to additional student loan debt and it likely won't lead to earlier completion of a PhD (most masters degrees don't transfer to PhD), but if you are determined to get your PhD it could help.

Response 65: Clinical psych is always very competitive and this year was absolutely brutal, so try not to feel too down! Several years between undergrad and grad is unfortunately very normal.   Have you been applying to listings on university website or to initial job ads from faculty? Often by the time it goes up on a university website, the spot is already filled. This isn't gatekeeping but you have to find the initial job ad. They send job ads to listservs, other professors, twitter (check out @CogNeuroJobs - there are recent ones hiring for RAs to work on depression & psychotic disorders). Reach out to your undergrad professors, anyone you've worked with and ask if they know anyone looking for an RA or lab manager or PhD student. I also know multiple people who've gotten positions just by cold emailing -- no connections, just a little good luck.   Fit might be worth thinking about too. Clinical psych departments tend to be focused on/prioritize therapy and behavioral studies and studies of better therapy interventions. If working with neuroimaging techniques (eeg, fMRI) is important to you and therapy is not, clinical psych departments might not be able to give you that.

They send job ads to listservs, other professors, twitter (check out @CogNeuroJobs - there are recent ones hiring for RAs to work on depression & psychotic disorders). Reach out to your undergrad professors, anyone you've worked with and ask if they know anyone looking for an RA or lab manager or PhD student. I also know multiple people who've gotten positions just by cold emailing -- no connections, just a little good luck.   Fit might be worth thinking about too. Clinical psych departments tend to be focused on/prioritize therapy and behavioral studies and studies of better therapy interventions. If working with neuroimaging techniques (eeg, fMRI) is important to you and therapy is not, clinical psych departments might not be able to give you that.
Response 90: I know there’s a lot of comments, but hopefully you see this. There’s this program called PREP funded by the NIH. It’s specifically for people of color who want to get their PhD. It’s a postbac program that’s runs a year, u get paid a livable salary to work in a research lab, and u get professional development and guidance as you apply to grad school. I applied to PRPE, got in, and I got into a few counseling psychology programs. I didn’t apply to any clinical programs but I got interviews/acceptances at pretty competitive programs.
Response 91: I'm a PI in mental health and addictions epidemiology in Canada. My lab uses health admin data to study effects of environmental stressors on mental health and addiction outcomes in marginalized and general population. We have a few funded projects that focus on sexual minorities. Im open to talk to students about graduate research opportunities - however I work in  a health and medical science department rather than psychology. Let me know if you have any questions.
Response 92: You mentioned developmental disorders - if you are interested in the 21 and younger phase of life, school psychology may be a route to consider. I'm currently a phd student in school psych and we have many students who engage in fmri/eeg work through labs in neuroscience and we go through the same APA licensure and credentialing process as clinical psychs if you go to an APA accredited SP phd program. Feel free to dm me if you're interested at all in how SP and clinical psych overlap.
Response 93: I skimmed most of the comments and didn't see anyone say this, but apologies if it has already been said. I got rejected from everywhere I applied on my first round and one of my profs told me to email the graduate director (or someone) and ask if they could give me info on why.   One director of graduate studies at a very prestigious university in my field responded to my email VERY nicely and even had a long, supportive phone call with me. He basically said my grades were great by my statement of interest wasn't specific enough. Probably not exactly what your case would be, but this is just to say that asking why would possibly yield productive information!
Response 94: If this is going to make you feel any better, as a PhD nearing graduation (which is akin to Zeno's Arrow Paradox),     > Discouraged Phd applicant on where to go from here  sounds better than,  > Depressed PhD graduate on where to go from here  Maybe it's a good thing that you are forced to do something alternative. You can always regain your strength and apply back a few years later.
Response 95: What are you stats? GPA GRE publication etc.
Response 96: I graduated with my BA in psych in 2018 and just started a lab position. It’s not entry level, and also I had lots of experience in CMH that they found very valuable. So in my case it wasn’t connections but specific experience.   Obviously the pandemic has really messed with academic research. We aren’t recruiting for our study yet and we have accepted that things will continue to stall for a bit, and I don’t think there’s room for another doctoral student in our lab. Although most PhD programs don’t really care about a masters (as in it doesn’t save you time in a doctoral program) doing a masters or MPS in clinical psych can help you get to know professors and get into a lab, which could be the connection you need to get into a good doctoral program.
Response 97: If you’re open to neuro PhDs, I would argue that’s a better route. This is based on comparing my experiences as a STEM PhD to the experiences of friends (and my psychologist) who have done PhDs in clinical psych. First, clinical psych does require working as a lab manager first, and that does seem to require having an “in”. Second, clinical psych is often a 7-10 year program, but a neuro PhD is 5-6. Third, as a BIPOC researching “hard” science (neuro) you have tons of exclusive opportunities for fellowships and grants. While this may be somewhat true in all disciplines, medically-relevant “hard” science has the most funding opportunities overall. Finally, PhDs in medical colleges have higher pay and fewer outside requirements (e.g. TA ships) compared to basically all other PhDs. The drawback of a neuro PhD is that it might be harder to work on the developmental effects of growing up in a marginalized community, but you can definitely find neuro opportunities in developmental disorders or mental health.  One last thing... Department’s admissions have been affected in a variety of ways due to the pandemic. If you decide to look into neuro PhD programs, you should look around to see if any you are interested in are still allowing applications.
Response 98: Clinical psychology is incredibly competitive in *any* year. My background is in psychology and I also studied mental health, so I know a ton of folks who went clinical; students who had 2-3 years of undergraduate RA experience + 1-2 years of lab management/full-time research experience + clinical hours up the wazoo sometimes had to apply two or even three rounds before getting offers, and that's with applying to 7-12 programs each round. Clinical psychology is *incredibly* competitive.  I'm also BIPOC and my research area was in the same general area as yours. Are you tied to being a clinician? Because if not, there are *lots* of other PhD programs that are less competitive where you can study that. Look at health psychology, neuroscience (if you have the background for it), or public health as other avenues.  If you are looking only at research assistant positions at universities in psychology departments, I would also expand that. First, you can look across the university: there are research coordinator jobs in the medical/health sciences departments of universities that may have relevant research going on, too (think psychiatry, neurobiology, public health, perhaps even nursing). The NIH has an IRT program that is targeted at preparing people for doctoral programs that are related to health.

Response 11: Meeting with the student really only promotes deviation from the school policies.  The best and safest way to do it to ensure all policy is followed and protect yourself is to report the violation as soon as you notice it and let the proper people handle it.  When people confront students they are more likely to bend the rules for particular students, and enforcement becomes uneven, and biased towards particular groups.  Everyone believes they will not be biased in their decisions but the end result does not change, and moving directly to an integrity board is best as it cuts out at least one layer that can be influenced.  Know some will think this is callous, but as an ed policy person who did research on cheating, this really is for the best.

Response 13: I'll join /u/SnowblindAlbino \- when I was in the teaching staff, notifying students caught in plagiarism was mandatory, because it not only gives the offending person the clear cause of their violation, but also prevents any subsequent complaints from the said student about being unfairly reprimanded. Everything regarding disciplinary measures - whether positive, or negative, should be as transparent as it's feasible to avoid any ethical issues and accusations of unethical behavior towards the teaching corps as well.

Response 26: Check your regulations first. A friend who teaches at a different institution to me ended up in hot water because their regulations stipulated that no discussion was allowed.
Response 27: We warn them by policy: any student caught in a violation is required to meet with the professor, who writes up a formal statement of the ""charges"" and evidence. The professor, the student, and a witness (usually the department chair) sign a form that says they have all reviewed the charges. The student can either agree that yes. they did it, or they can appeal-- but they have to sign the form acknowledging the charges and the penalty, which can range from failing the assignment to failing the entire course. The form and evidence then go to the dean's office. If it happens twice in their college career they risk expulsion.  As a department chair I like the system because it 1) ensures the student does indeed know they have been caught and face consequences, and 2) eliminates any questions about the charges. Parents can't call and say ""My  Johnny would never cheat!"" and students can't claim ""I didn't know \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ was a violation!"" because it is all documented. I'd say 9/10 students almost immediately admit their wrongdoing when we meet to do the paperwork; the few that do not usually end their appeal when they meet with the dean, who will always back up the faculty/chair in academic dishonesty cases that are documented. Tears are not uncommon at this stage (from the students), though 4/5 of the accused tend to be male on our campus.

Response 30: I'll join /u/SnowblindAlbino \- when I was in the teaching staff, notifying students caught in plagiarism was mandatory, because it not only gives the offending person the clear cause of their violation, but also prevents any subsequent complaints from the said student about being unfairly reprimanded. Everything regarding disciplinary measures - whether positive, or negative, should be as transparent as it's feasible to avoid any ethical issues and accusations of unethical behavior towards the teaching corps as well.
Response 31: Check your regulations first. A friend who teaches at a different institution to me ended up in hot water because their regulations stipulated that no discussion was allowed.

Response 33: Have you talked to your dept. chair? There are rules on the books, and then there is university/dept. culture. My personal preference is to tell the student what I'm about to do, then make the report. It's really easy otherwise for students to get an undeserved clean slate otherwise at the start of every new semester.  I also make a point of bringing up the honor code at the start of class, including showing students the list of things that would break that code. That's their warning - they need to think through what they're about to do before they do it.  In addition, all incoming students are informed of the code, but for the most part they don't even remember it later because it's done during orientation.  I really want to take students at their word, but my attitude is now, ""trust, but verify."" Show me proof you actually started that paper prior to the deadline, for example, if you want me to believe that it didn't get uploaded correctly.

12,"Do you ever feel too dumb for academia? I started a job recently as a junior researcher at one of the universities in my state. It’s a job made for recent undergraduates which helps someone get either into academia or help them decide if they want to pursue a career in research. I’m about two months into my job and I’m already struggling with how the people in it make me feel. I work directly under a Post Doc with a supervising professor, along with a few other researches scattered here and there.   My biggest issue right now is that with my supervisor (post doc) I always feel like she’s looking down on me and she’s told me a few times already she needs me to take more initiative and get things done. My problem with that is that there ain’t always work for me to do everyday and what we need to get done is never laid out, exactly when she wants to do it and when it should get done. I’m grasping at straws and I’m trying to keep up with all the information they are telling me about the current study we are doing and I’m extremely overwhelmed.   I feel like I’m 8 again sitting at the adults table not understanding anything they are asking me or what they are talking about.  My biggest question for you guys is that do you feel this way too in academia? That people think you’re too dumb to understand everything or that if you don’t get what they are telling you right away it’s not worth their time to explain it.","Response 0: To answer your question, yes. I sometimes feel too dumb for academia. Felt that way a lot this week with some new colleagues.    I'm also a full professor. So I think I somehow got by anyway. :D

Response 2: To answer your question, yes. I sometimes feel too dumb for academia. Felt that way a lot this week with some new colleagues.    I'm also a full professor. So I think I somehow got by anyway. :D
Response 3: Firstly, you're not 'dumb' at all. Some people are better at management than others, and it doesn't quite sound like you're getting the support you need to succeed here. Or you might just need more time to adjust to this environment.   Keep asking questions, keep learning. Maybe ask for a sit down meeting with your supervisor to work through some of this?
Response 4: Sometimes I don't think people should be allowed to be in academia unless they think they're too dumb for academia, at least on occasion.   When I started my PhD I was lucky to follow 10% of the meetings I was in, even the ones about my own project. By the end of my PhD I still could only follow about 70 - 80% of what my advisors were talking about, and that was on a good day.   I tell grad students that like 50% of doing a PhD is learning how to be comfortable with feeling dumb, knowing how to put things on a shelf that future you will figure out, because it's a skill to be gentle with yourself when you don't know things, especially when a lot of grad students have been high achievers their whole lives and don't know how to exist in a space where not knowing everything is not only expected, but required.   Basically I make mistakes and feel dumb about something every single day.
Response 5: Stay in your position and ride it out. You’re going to learn A LOT. I work at a school and all of my coworkers are smart, it’s actually intimidating. My boss has a doctorate’s and I had daily meetings with her. Very smart and understanding woman. But I do freak out a lot and feel like I’m not smart enough to be there. I’m only a junior..and feel defeated some days because I feel “dumb” but at the same time it drives me to want to learn more because I’m always surrounded by people who continuously make an effort to become more informed.  Ask more questions (something I need to work on as well) find somebody at your job that can become somewhat of a mentor. Please keep trying and please don’t be so hard on yourself. You’re still learning. Stay on top of your tasks and make sure to communicate!! I’ve gotten in trouble for my lack of communication skills..just ask, some people are always willing to help (:

Response 7: You are actually asking two different things - do we feel dumb, and in the last bit do other people treat us as too dumb.  To answer the first one (do we sometimes feel like we are overmatched) the answer is yes, I think for most of us.  I got invited to submit a review in an area I have published in.  Was not going to bother, but thought it might be good for some more junior staff I work with on occasion who are doing some work in that area also.  I now have the review draft, and they took an incredibly detailed point of view (I would have taken a much broader perspective), and completely screwed it up. I am working to fix it, and boy, am I struggling- going back to the literature shows me how much I do not know in this area, and I am wondering how I ever got anything published!  So yes, some days I do feel overmatched by academia - despite having published well over 200 papers.  But I will struggle my way through it, and hope and pray I do not make a huge mistake that the reviewers spot! (and if anyone is wondering, I am playing hooky and the review is open in the other window, waiting for me to confront my ignorance once again!)  For your second point, no, generally people do not think I am dumb (obviously), but that issue is nothing about you.  It is just absurdly poor supervision.  Nobody goes into a research environment ""fully loaded"".  We pick it up over years (or decades!).  A failure of the post-doc to realize and accept that is just poor skills on their part.  Stick at it, keep learning and one day you will get enough knowledge and experience so that you can fake it like the rest of us.
Response 8: Yes, I think I am too dumb to understand everything, and probably if someone thinks differently they might have some issue.

Response 12: You're a recent undergraduate working as a junior researcher. Of fucking course you feel dumb. Because no offense but you really *don't* know anything. You're years if not decades behind everyone else in learning these things. And that's ok. It's why postgraduate degrees and these sorts of jobs exist. You'll figure it out, it just takes time. That doesn't mean you're dumb though, it means you're not knowledgeable. Those are very different things.  And your supervisor should understand this. After all they were in your exact position not that long ago. Maybe still are. If they're looking down on you that's probably their problem, not yours. I agree with the other comments here. It would be a good idea to talk with your peers and/or your supervisor about expectations and how you're doing. And don't be afraid to ask your supervisor for help, both in terms of information you don't understand and in terms of your works skills. That's why they're there

Response 14: It is very normal to feel overwhelmed during your first research experience. Very, very normal.   A difficult aspect of research is that it is somewhat open ended. Nobody will be able to give you a 'syllabus' of what you need to do. With taking initiative, the person may mean that they want you to come up with useful things to do, instead of waiting for someone to give you an 'assignment'. This is an important part of research, but it takes time to learn, and is very different from doing coursework.  I second the advice to talk to other students in the lab, in particular to ask them: how do they prioritize tasks, and in what ways do they take initiative?

13,"Do you get to do much/any technical work as a tenured professor? Or is it all just project management, admin, and supervision? I recently got tenure (or the rough equivalent, as I am in Europe). It is a big relief to finally have a secure position, but I have been feeling less satisfied with my job lately and it seems like it is only going to get worse as I get more senior. I love research and also enjoy teaching, so it has always felt like academia is a good fit for me, but now I am seriously considering moving to industry instead.      The main reason for this is that I am doing less and less technical work myself: programming, building testbeds, running experiments, analysing data, writing papers. I am spending more and more time in meetings, supervising PhD students, applying for grants, writing project reports, and doing service work. I like supervising students, but don't want that to be all I do, and most of the rest of it I don't like doing. I can accept that it's a part of the job and needs to be, but if there is no more time for anything creative or technical I don't think I would enjoy my job overall anymore. I miss solving problems, the feeling of ""flow"", and the satisfaction of creating something myself.  For those of you who are tenured, especially more senior (e.g. full professor), do you get time for your own creative or technical work? How do you spend your time and do you feel like you have a good balance between the different parts of your job? Is it all email, spreadsheets, and meetings from here on out if I stay in academia?","Response 0: As a warning: This can also happen in industry. As you get promoted, you move into managing teams of researchers and having days filled with meetings, rather than the technical work which is often handled by junior researchers. (This may vary by field and company, however.)
Response 1: I am still at the postdoc level,so I do not have direct experience. I have seen tenured staff handling their time quite differently. At my current institute, the tenured people are actually working on research projects. This was quite a surprise for me because that was pretty different from my PhD experience, where people were more teaching/service oriented.     I think one of the challenges is time management, especially with regard to teaching and meetings. I have several days that are not completely filled up, but I have maybe an hour or so between meetings. This is usually not enough for me to really get into 'research mode'. So I spend those in between hours reading papers, or doing miscellaneous stuff.  I try to schedule all my meetings on the same day or I try to create continuous blocks of meetings/service work. Is something like that possible for you? You could try to block off 1 day or a certain set of hours each week (e.g. Tuesday morning). I try to keep Wednesday free from anything other than research. Then you can use that time to scratch your research itch.

Response 3: In the end, at least for me, it came down to cost effectiveness.  Where am I adding value to the lab?  Any decent student can do the experiments as well as I could (or honestly, often better!) so my time spent on the bench is not cost effective.  On the flip side that student cannot do grants/reports/papers as well as I can, which is where I am adding value to the lab.  The other way looking at it is that i can do one set of experiments, a lab full of students can do dozens of MY experiments.

Response 1: I relate! But I try to embrace the periods where things are less hectic, a motor going constantly at high speed will burn itself out after all. Being busy is not morally better then having downtime. Take the time you have now so that when you need to amp up again you're coming from a solid foundation.   Personally I use low busy periods to restablish my exercise routine, do some cleaning and cooking so I'll have leftovers, reconnect with my relationships.

15,Emailing author of journal article for access. Poor ettiquete? I recently became aware of a Doctor because they are working with a patient of mine.   We will likely have no professional contact through this patient although we do work within neighbouring health boards and have a crossover of colleagues.   A quick Google search showed they had written thirty articles but I am interested in reading three of them. They are relevant to my job as they specifically  discuss the demographic I work with.  Would it be appropriate to email them and ask if they could share these articles with me? It would be purely for my learning and to develop my practice.   I have tried to access them through alumni channels with no success.,"Response 0: First try to access the paper through pubmed central all of the articles in that database are open access.  Then feel free to email the corresponding author.  Hell I usually randomly email several people a month asking questions about their research.  They either will be excited to talk about their work or ignore your email.
Response 1: You can also just type the title into sci-hub.se and download it

Response 1: From what I understand, you're going to strike a balance. Hit up the folks that know you best from all the institutions you've been employed in.

I've known several people who are doing exactly the same thing, and, as long as you keep it professional, you shouldn't have a problem. You'll want to have a meeting with those people, of course, so that you can sit down and explain the rationale.   Letters are always tertiary, anyway. Focus most of your effort on the stuff you can control.

Response 1: Don't use Mendeley: they are owned by Elsevier, and so are now evil. Didn't use to be evil, but now they are.  Many people use Zotero (open-source).  I used to collect all stuff I read in one giant super-review, like a review of everything I know. But as my interests shifted and spread out, it became impossible.  For a while I had an Excel-like table (Google Sheets) with a paragraph written about every paper, and a list of papers I want too read. But now it became so huge that it takes 2 minutes to load, and I hate it. It's still kind of useful, as I use keywords as internal tags, but I stopped adding stuff to it.  I also tried to run a personal wiki (aka ""Knowledge base""). There are some great free wikis out there: Zim is great, then there's also Tomboy (aka Gnome), and Wiki that comes with any repo on GitHub. But it takes a bit of effort, and also I am kinda afraid to create a knowledge base with nooks and crannies, as I'm afraid to forget about some nooks and crannies. I want to be able to ""see everything"" every now and then, even if just to remind myself of what is out there.  Now for about 2 weeks I'm trying a new approach, where for every paper I read I start a markdown file (using Typora editor, which is one of the coolest pieces of software I ever encountered). All of these markdowns are in a git repo that I synchronize with Github, which means that I have access to them from everywere. I know some really cool people that use this approach, so I hope it will work, but I haven't yet quite figured out my personal feelings about it. The actual test will happen at the point when I'll need to write something (an intro, or a review), and so will have to find all relevant papers on a topic. We'll see how easy it would be.  My ""knowledge base of dreams"" would probably look more like a database, a collection of cards, where every card is filed with a bunch of tags. And then I want to be able to see a tag cloud, and easily get all records for any given tag. It's relatively easy to organize something like that with Tomboy, but it's not automatic. I guess I could have written my own piece of software for that, but for now I'm lazy. Maybe I'll do it in the future; that could be fun actually, especially if it's based on markdown files, and so would be compatible with my current approach.
Response 2: I'm currently at the beginning of my PhD, but this is a system I've used since 2015. I use endnote and Word simultaneously:  **EndNote** (or any other reference manager): I find, index, tag with relevant keywords and sort references into folders based on topic. I also add the article PDF to the reference and mark out interesting sections. Unread articles are marked as ""unread"", and articles can be easily searched by looking through topic folders or searching for keywords.  **Word**: I have a ""literature document"" where I have headings that are similar to the folders in EndNote.  I copy the article reference from EndNote and format it as a sub-heading, and while reading and marking in Endnote, I make short notes in the Word document. Then the navigation pane works as an index of the topics and related articles. I also always add page numbers to interesting information, so it's easy to go back to the text.   I have a list in the beginning of the document of articles I want to read, but haven't yet downloaded, indexed in EndNote or made notes of.    I also sometimes have notes for articles that aren't yet indexed in Endnote, and they are easy to find because the reference isn't formatted the same as the indexed ones.   It's a system that takes a bit of time to implement and follow up, but when I manage to use it properly it works really well. Saved my ass a bunch of times when trying to finish my masters in too little time.

Response 4: Mendeley
Response 5: I just heard this great strategy from a professor. You can keep an excel spreadsheet with columns detailing the articles, authors, and implications as well as a brief summary for each paper in a given row.  I've always just printed papers, annotated them, and filed physical copies, or kept them in folders on my desktop. I think a spreadsheet is a fantastic way to go forward, and I'll be trying this especially for lit reviews.
Response 6: The docear system http://www.docear.org/ was specificly developed for academic litterature   I can download my pdf, highlight the passages of interest and save the pdf in a specific folder. Then all my annotations can be found on the docear software, which is basically a mind mapping system.  You can directly organize and  modify all the highlighted textes and ideas in a mind map. For exemple i currently have a pathways: hepatocyte->cell function->proliferation->promitogenic->HGF->concentrations-> PHH  at which end and i can directly find the HGF concentrations used by different teams on PHH.    Bonus point for having the automatic reference of the paper by clicking on the node.   Extra bonus point for being able to export the mind map in .tex /word/libreoffice format. My thesis basically wrote itself.

Response 12: I use Dropbox - I have a ""Papers"" folder divided into topics, and every paper I read / should read goes into the topic, named <authors>-<year>, since that's often how I (and many people I think)  categorize scientific results, as well as reference. I read these papers on tablet with a stylus and the app ezPDF Reader. So rough topical organization but nothing like keywords or anything.  I use Bibtex for referencing my written work, which is a single document with all the papers named with the same naming scheme (<authors>-<year>), so there's no searching around there - just look at the title of paper I'm reading to get the reference.  Actually, I just checked out Zotero from this discussion, and it looks interesting. Maybe something to check out for myself....

Response 15: Don't use Mendeley: they are owned by Elsevier, and so are now evil. Didn't use to be evil, but now they are.  Many people use Zotero (open-source).  I used to collect all stuff I read in one giant super-review, like a review of everything I know. But as my interests shifted and spread out, it became impossible.  For a while I had an Excel-like table (Google Sheets) with a paragraph written about every paper, and a list of papers I want too read. But now it became so huge that it takes 2 minutes to load, and I hate it. It's still kind of useful, as I use keywords as internal tags, but I stopped adding stuff to it.  I also tried to run a personal wiki (aka ""Knowledge base""). There are some great free wikis out there: Zim is great, then there's also Tomboy (aka Gnome), and Wiki that comes with any repo on GitHub. But it takes a bit of effort, and also I am kinda afraid to create a knowledge base with nooks and crannies, as I'm afraid to forget about some nooks and crannies. I want to be able to ""see everything"" every now and then, even if just to remind myself of what is out there.  Now for about 2 weeks I'm trying a new approach, where for every paper I read I start a markdown file (using Typora editor, which is one of the coolest pieces of software I ever encountered). All of these markdowns are in a git repo that I synchronize with Github, which means that I have access to them from everywere. I know some really cool people that use this approach, so I hope it will work, but I haven't yet quite figured out my personal feelings about it. The actual test will happen at the point when I'll need to write something (an intro, or a review), and so will have to find all relevant papers on a topic. We'll see how easy it would be.  My ""knowledge base of dreams"" would probably look more like a database, a collection of cards, where every card is filed with a bunch of tags. And then I want to be able to see a tag cloud, and easily get all records for any given tag. It's relatively easy to organize something like that with Tomboy, but it's not automatic.

Response 16: I just heard this great strategy from a professor. You can keep an excel spreadsheet with columns detailing the articles, authors, and implications as well as a brief summary for each paper in a given row.  I've always just printed papers, annotated them, and filed physical copies, or kept them in folders on my desktop. I think a spreadsheet is a fantastic way to go forward, and I'll be trying this especially for lit reviews.

Response 20: I'm currently at the beginning of my PhD, but this is a system I've used since 2015. I use endnote and Word simultaneously:  **EndNote** (or any other reference manager): I find, index, tag with relevant keywords and sort references into folders based on topic. I also add the article PDF to the reference and mark out interesting sections. Unread articles are marked as ""unread"", and articles can be easily searched by looking through topic folders or searching for keywords.  **Word**: I have a ""literature document"" where I have headings that are similar to the folders in EndNote.  I copy the article reference from EndNote and format it as a sub-heading, and while reading and marking in Endnote, I make short notes in the Word document. Then the navigation pane works as an index of the topics and related articles. I also always add page numbers to interesting information, so it's easy to go back to the text.   I have a list in the beginning of the document of articles I want to read, but haven't yet downloaded, indexed in EndNote or made notes of.    I also sometimes have notes for articles that aren't yet indexed in Endnote, and they are easy to find because the reference isn't formatted the same as the indexed ones.   It's a system that takes a bit of time to implement and follow up, but when I manage to use it properly it works really well. Saved my ass a bunch of times when trying to finish my masters in too little time.

Response 27: The docear system http://www.docear.org/ was specificly developed for academic litterature   I can download my pdf, highlight the passages of interest and save the pdf in a specific folder. Then all my annotations can be found on the docear software, which is basically a mind mapping system.  You can directly organize and  modify all the highlighted textes and ideas in a mind map. For exemple i currently have a pathways: hepatocyte->cell function->proliferation->promitogenic->HGF->concentrations-> PHH  at which end and i can directly find the HGF concentrations used by different teams on PHH.    Bonus point for having the automatic reference of the paper by clicking on the node.   Extra bonus point for being able to export the mind map in .tex /word/libreoffice format. My thesis basically wrote itself.

Response 31: Use zotero and set up collections and sub collections to categorize the papers you are reading. This helps in keeping stuff organized instead of being just one huge pile.  Then when you take notes while reading papers, you can add an ""attachment"" to the zotero parent entry to store your notes. If you're taking handwritten notes, scan and make a pdf and then add it to the zotero parent item. Sometimes, I take notes in lyx or word. In that case, I simply attach the file to the parent item.  Finally, set up zotero to store its database in your dropbox folder if you can **or** just back the folder up every once in a while to whatever service your prefer.  Mucking around with folders and renaming them and organizing them is a fools errand and I have realized that too late. Just let zotero handle all that low level nonsense.  Zotero is like itunes when it was at its peak design. It helps you organize everything.

Response 1: I imagine the best thing to do is to first determine what is the reason that thinking about a new project makes you feel stressed out and avoidant. Is it fear that you will fail? Concerns that others will judge you? Worried about getting attached to something that you won’t be able to finish? Or that you won’t have time to dedicate to the project? I don’t think you can really move forward without doing some excavation of what exactly it is that is holding you back.   Also, I think it’s important to ask yourself whether you really are passionate about these subjects anymore. Just because you were at one time doesn’t mean you have to continue to be. Maybe there are other subjects that are more deserving of your passion and energy now.

This just goes on and on...what makes it harder I have found is no one can actually say how far you go back and or which one to cite. I can't help but wonder if it is easier just to cite A?","Response 0: For references to original theories, I always say go back to the original source. Few things bother me more in journal articles than when I read an article that is explicitly about theory ABC which was introduced in, for example, 1980, but the article then proceeds to only cite articles from 2010 and on as their sources about the theory. Give credit to the people who made the theory, especially if the focus of your article is on said theory; you should know the original source(s) and use them!  For references to replicated research findings, I recommend going to the most reputable source. Including multiple citations is always an option as well (at least in my field) though that can eat up a lot of words in our already limited journal space.
Response 1: I doubt you'll get a golden rule because it likely is subject dependent.  My approach would be to cite the most recent relevant source and in my footnote/endnote say something like:   see further ABC; BCD; and DEF.  If your search indicates one of those past sources is cited 27,000 times, it makes sense to try to ensure that is included in your reference list.  Do you go back to Socrates to discuss relationships? Do you go back to Taylor to discuss organisational design?  Probably not necessary... But your writing may demonstrate greater mastery if you do.

Response 6: Well if you are citing FINDINGS, then, generally speaking, the more recent the better.   If you are developing a theoretical or conceptual framework, then it at least makes sense to signal the original work so you can show which interpretation/strand of that theory you are working with.
Response 7: You should aim to cite the primary source(a) of your claim. If the claim your making is a well established concept and you’re limited in the number of references to use, then you could then cite a well regarded and comprehensive review that includes and explains those primary sources and write it “as reviewed by”.   I’m in the camp of merging both and typically cite the primary source(s) and a well regarded and comprehensive review. I do it as that’s what I wish to find when consuming academic literature.
Response 8: Use the most reputable source
Response 9: Cite the source where YOU got this information from. If you only read article A, only cure article A. If you stumble upon sonething in article A but it doesn't have enough detail so you read article B, cite article B. If article A adds something important to what is said in Article B, you can always cite both.

Response 11: References are meant to support the statements in your paper. If your sentence is, ""A recent meta-analysis showed a link between hamburger consumption and elevated cortisol,"" and the meta-analysis was the first to establish this link, then you cite the meta-analysis even if it used previously published data. If the link had already been established prior to the meta-analysis then you rewrite your sentence to something like, ""Five independent studies showed a link between hamburger consumption and cortisol, with two also implicating shamrock shakes,"" and cite all five.  Think of it like this: if someone were to challenge your statement, e.g. by saying ""I'm pretty sure hamburgers actually lower cortisol levels,"" what paper(s) would you have them read to convince them you're right? Cite those.

21,"I'll be attending my first scientific conference soon. Any advice for a newbie? As the title says, I'll be attending my first scientific conference soon. I won't be giving an oral presentation but posters I created will be shown.  It's unlikely that any colleagues will be coming with me so I was wondering if anyone had any tips for what to do/ what not to do at the conference and any tips for networking and making the most of the trip.  All help is appreciated. Thank you all.","Response 0: The comments here already are good. I would add 3 other/similar suggestions. 1) Look at the schedule ahead of time to figure out what talks/meetings you want to go to. Depending on the size of the conference, there can be so many things happening at the same time in different parts of the venue, it’s easy to get lost in the sea of choices, so having a general game plan beforehand can be really helpful. 2) Be ready to be tired if you’re going to be attending multiple days. The first day is exciting and cool. By the third, the day drags on and every talk begins to sound the same. Being mentally prepared for that ahead of time can helps soften the impact if it. 3) A lot of connections happen after the conference. People will often go out afterwards to drink/talk and will be more relaxed. Great opportunity to try and (respectfully) make a connection. Sometimes the big vendors will host a party at a local restaurant/bar (you might see these advertised at a vendor exhibition showroom if they have one). These can be a big hotspots for social activity. Since you dont have anyone you’re going with, check ahead of time if there’s anyone you know that has connections to ppl that will be at the conference.
Response 1: The social and networking aspect is at least as important as the science and knowledge part. Do not neglect the first.
Response 2: Present your poster! It isn't about the work but more about meeting different people. Renowned researchers come by student posters looking for fresh ideas. You might even land a good collaboration with one later.
Response 3: Most conferences have a fixed time for poster viewing.  When the time is for your presentation - be by your poster.  You never know who stop for a look.

Response 10: Talk to everyone. Follow up later with as many as you can
Response 11: I'm going to contradict a couple other suggestions you've received, but my advice as a mid-career researcher with lots of ""annual meetings"" behind me, is don't feel the need to talk to everyone, or even most people.  Unauthentic conversations are painful for you and also painful for whoever you've approached out of the blue!  Rather, go to receptions, publisher socials, happy hours etc and just observe, make small talk.  If there's a real aligning of research interests, by all means let the conversation flow naturally.  But don't force anything - being friendly and observant is actually going to take you far just by themselves.  Also, if you attend some talks or panels, and you genuinely find one interesting, approaching them after the talk or during the break is usually going to go well, even if it's just to thank them for the talk.

Response 13: Don't forget your glasses. Nothing as awkward as not being able to see the speakers properly and then not recognising them when they come to your poster. Not saying I did this...  Seriously though, enjoy yourself. Go to the posters, chat to people, but don't force yourself into networking if that's not the way you work, and don't pressure yourself. I personally hate conferences so a good for conference for me is some interesting talks and food that isn't a sandwich. You don't have to be a miserable arse like me but don't try and force yourself to do more than you're comfortable with. Pace yourself, take time out if you need it, go to the talks, and just relax. Enjoy the experience!

Response 19: If they do drink tickets, give some away to the vendors.  They generally don’t get any or not enough to sit through a whole day of a conference at a display booth.  I did it at a conference and once word got out I was being invited to sit at tables with some of those companies at the evening dinners.  Not say you should do it to help you get a job, do it to be nice, but don’t be surprised if they’re a lot more personal with you afterwards.

22,"Idea: Is reading papers on mobile in high demand? Researchers, scholars, PhDs, graduate students, bachelors, and students:  Does anyone like to read papers when commuting on mobile? If I am planning to make a new product to read in a lightweight way, would you like to use that?","Response 0: Sounds like a great idea. I would read papers on mobile more often if it were easier.
Response 1: I always need to take notes when reading papers, so I don't see how it would fit into my work flow.
Response 2: For me no. The issue is that I need to be able to see the overall page which is not really possible on mobile as the text would be small. My fields are math, engineering and life sciences.
Response 3: For me no. The issue is that I need to be able to see the overall page which is not really possible on mobile as the text would be small. My fields are math, engineering and life sciences.
Response 4: Definitely sounds like something I'd be interested in.

Response 9: Yes.  I kind of do this already by emailing articles to Kindle.  But obvs text can be very small when the articles are in pdf format

Response 13: Yes.  I kind of do this already by emailing articles to Kindle.  But obvs text can be very small when the articles are in pdf format
Response 14: I greatly prefer printing out literature to read and dissect them. It's less distracting, no screen, and the basic tools of a highlighter and note pad help me learn the best. But reading abstracts and looking at figures on mobile are pretty standard for me.
Response 15: I find the ReMarkable device to be my favorite digital option for reading pdfs and taking notes on them.
Response 16: Definitely sounds like something I'd be interested in.
Response 17: Not a fan. There's just too much to digest on a small screen. I get frustrated swiping back and forth or zooming constantly

Response 24: Not a fan. There's just too much to digest on a small screen. I get frustrated swiping back and forth or zooming constantly
Response 25: I have always printed out articles, highlighted and annotated them, and then use a mobile scanner to store them online. The only way I'd use an online tool is if there was an easy-to-use set of tools to highlight, annotate, and maybe draw with a finger (arrows, diagrams, etc.)

Response 29: I’d love it if I’d be able to annotate..make notes to self and be able to see an index of those later on….would make sense in the corporate space for sure
Response 30: If it were easier to read, yes, would love it very much.  The current formats on mobile are hard to maneuver and focus on the part you want to.

Response 35: Yes! Postdoc in neuroscience here. The current options SUCK... I used to use ReadCube on an iPhone a few years ago but it was glitchy, slow, and I ditched ReadCube completely when it became a yearly subscription business.  In order for this to succeed it 1) must handle institutional access seamlessly 2) be free, or very low cost. I just want something that can load a PDF using institutional login, and properly display it on mobile, and maybe be able to leave sticky notes. That's it.

Response 43: I am making an app for this, in the mean time adobe liquid mode might be useful for short papers.
Response 44: I already do it. I do highlighting and small notes in PDFs, make additional, larger notes in Obsidian.  What makes my life hard is writing papers using all those scattered notes together with Zotero. Would be nice if I could just organize my marked citations in a template, then fill the blanks and have the references filled automatically.

Response 46: Not mobile - but I have really found success in using a good note-taking app (like Notability) on my iPad and uploading PDFs to it. The usability is great, I can make notes with my apple pencil, highlight, and reupload to my computer. An app that made it easy for me to make my notes on my iPad and integrate them into a reference manager in real-time would be a game changer though.

Response 57: I already do it. I do highlighting and small notes in PDFs, make additional, larger notes in Obsidian.

Response 85: I’d use that
Response 86: Nope, never; I don't read, watch, or view anything on my phone. It's way too small. I won't even use a laptop with a screen <15"".  My workstation is 2x27"" monitors and 1x44"" for comparison-- in reality I most often read PDFs on the largest monitor in fact.  I have zero interest in ever reading anything work-related on a tiny screen.

Response 87: I have always printed out articles, highlighted and annotated them, and then use a mobile scanner to store them online. The only way I'd use an online tool is if there was an easy-to-use set of tools to highlight, annotate, and maybe draw with a finger (arrows, diagrams, etc.)

Response 218: Yes! Postdoc in neuroscience here. The current options SUCK... I used to use ReadCube on an iPhone a few years ago but it was glitchy, slow, and I ditched ReadCube completely when it became a yearly subscription business.  In order for this to succeed it 1) must handle institutional access seamlessly 2) be free, or very low cost. I just want something that can load a PDF using institutional login, and properly display it on mobile, and maybe be able to leave sticky notes. That's it. I'm willing to pay may $10-20/yr maximum for this and would strongly prefer it to be free to use.

Response 236: Not mobile - but I have really found success in using a good note-taking app (like Notability) on my iPad and uploading PDFs to it. The usability is great, I can make notes with my apple pencil, highlight, and reupload to my computer. An app that made it easy for me to make my notes on my iPad and integrate them into a reference manager in real-time would be a game changer though.
Response 237: Yes! Postdoc in neuroscience here. The current options SUCK... I used to use ReadCube on an iPhone a few years ago but it was glitchy, slow, and I ditched ReadCube completely when it became a yearly subscription business.  In order for this to succeed it 1) must handle institutional access seamlessly 2) be free, or very low cost. I just want something that can load a PDF using institutional login, and properly display it on mobile, and maybe be able to leave sticky notes. That's it. I'm willing to pay may $10-20/yr maximum for this and would strongly prefer it to be free to use.

24,"Is a Masters/PhD as a single parent of a toddler possible? I have a 2yo and am about to be divorced.

Is getting a Masters or PhD with a small, daycare-age child feasible?  My soon-to-be-ex-husband is saying if I want to get my advanced degree I will have to give him full custody of my daughter because financially and time-wise its not possible. Advice? Comments? Anyone who has successfully done this and can advise one way or the other? Concerns and solutions?","Response 0: So I’ve recently started taking care of my mom who has dementia, on a postdoc stipend. I think in many ways it’s like taking care of a toddler as a single parent. There’s no one to help around the house at all, no one to shuttle between or schedule endless doctors appointments, no one to provide support in any capacity, just endless need. It is exceedingly difficult to spend the amount t of time I need to spend doing science with these responsibilities.  Someone posted here sometime ago about Ruth Bader Ginsburg saying that having a family forced her to be more deliberate about her working hours. I think if you feel mentally strong and like you have a stable support system you should be able to manage.   Without a support system I can tell you it is exceedingly difficult to meet the demands of the job while being a kind, patient, caring human at home.

Response 3: Really depends on location and support network. Being a single parent is hard but you’d have a consistent stipend and health insurance while a graduate student. I’ve had friends do it
Response 4: This is so individual that you'd have to give more information about yourself (which isn't super safe on reddit) and honestly still have to figure it out yourself tbh. Lots of people have families while in the PhD. Lots of people, equally, have no life outside their studies. Some of it is individual, but it also depends on their department, the research they're doing, probably the field...  >  I will have to give him full custody of my daughter because financially and time-wise its not possible.  As in, he's threatening to sue you for full custody if you begin a graduate program? There's not really an environment where you, a legal adult, have to give another legal adult your child outside of a court order. In which case you should probably speak to a lawyer.  The nice thing about grad school is that you have a lot of control over your schedule and where you physically are (although, again, field dependent - if you're an experimentalist or a field scientist, your experiment rules your life and you have to be in the field/in the lab). But, it doesn't pay much (in case of master's, not at all), it's a fair amount of work (def 40 hours+) that requires high concentration and thus is less than ideal to be done while watching a child, not all institutions are fully supportive (and some will pull stunts like take away grad students' health insurance a month before matriculation...), and the life after a PhD is precarious in most fields geographically and income wise.   fwiw not in wildlife science but a few of my college buddies went on to work for national parks and they have just BAs, often in bio but just as often in random stuff like American Studies.
Response 5: Unless you have a second income stream (from a partner or a parent or investments or whatever), it's very unwise. The PhD stipend is perfectly fine for one person but wouldn't go very far with two. Masters students aren't guaranteed to be paid at all.
Response 6: I'm in grad school and honestly at least 50% of students in my field and related fields are parents and most do not have a partner working full time (single or are both students) so this is a very frequent situation in practice so many people do it so I'm surprised he is framing it as impossible  Honestly it depends on a lot of factors:  \-What country are you in? Some countries give out special financial help to parents studying and universities nowadays mostly all have a parent-student association were you can reach out to them and see what kind of support you can get. Note that some have very elaborated policies and resources, look into it!  \-What field are you planning to study in? Some will require more on-campus work with crazy hours (if you need to be in the lab for example) and other will have more flexibility  \-Let's be honest, do you have family/ friends support to help balance the time management issues you'll encounter? I know we hear ""it takes a village"" but yep as a student it's even more accurate  Money wise:  \-Do you plan on working part-time at your current job (many do this when they come back to grad school after kids)? Or you can do a part-time Master? Par-time is not a good idea for a phd though.  \-Will you receive financial support when divorced? You most likely will and even more if you split custody with the father, so take it into account too since most countries have mandatory obligations in the laws, you wouldn't be penniless either...  \-Are scholarships available in the field you are going into? Would you be garanteed funding? Would you be limited to work in the university or can you work outside too?  \-Do you have financial resources that you can use during this period? Are you open to getting a loan?  In the end know it's possible and many many women do it (and some single men too!). i'm not saying it's easy and you'll need a good organization, discipline and willpower but it's not ridiculous or impossible at all.
Response 7: I am a single mom who works full-time as a high school teacher and am five semesters deep into my PhD. My daughter was two when I started so it is possible but not easy. It’s helpful if you have a supportive community.

Response 10: I'm a single mom in academia here to tell you that it is ABSOLUTELY possible. Academia gives you unique flexibilities that normal jobs don't.

Response 12: Yes. I passed with distinction :)
Response 13: Possible yes, but I dont envy you the task
Response 14: Okay. So I studied for an MSc and a PhD and I have a toddler. But I'm not single. After the age of 4, maybe 3, and assuming you do have some help (your parents maybe), and the kid has an 8 to 4 kindergarten, and you have a nice instructor (most in science will not accept it if you leave at 3:30 every day - find one who does), it can be done. The most important thing: after you finish your PhD, if you want an academic career, the clock starts ticking. The period after the terminal degree (PhD) is counted. Many opportunities will be open only for people with X years since the PhD. Women who take a long leave AFTER their PhD regret it. Take it during. No one cares if the PhD took you 3 years or 8 years to finish. It does matter, greatly, how many years pass AFTER the PhD, for many opportunities.

In the end know it's possible and many many women do it (and some single men too!). i'm not saying it's easy and you'll need a good organization, discipline and willpower but it's not ridiculous or impossible at all.
Response 22: Possible yes, but I dont envy you the task
Response 23: Really depends on location and support network. Being a single parent is hard but you’d have a consistent stipend and health insurance while a graduate student. I’ve had friends do it

Response 26: Okay. So I studied for an MSc and a PhD and I have a toddler. But I'm not single. After the age of 4, maybe 3, and assuming you do have some help (your parents maybe), and the kid has an 8 to 4 kindergarten, and you have a nice instructor (most in science will not accept it if you leave at 3:30 every day - find one who does), it can be done. The most important thing: after you finish your PhD, if you want an academic career, the clock starts ticking. The period after the terminal degree (PhD) is counted. Many opportunities will be open only for people with X years since the PhD. Women who take a long leave AFTER their PhD regret it. Take it during. No one cares if the PhD took you 3 years or 8 years to finish. It does matter, greatly, how many years pass AFTER the PhD, for many opportunities.
Response 27: Not many people have talked about this, but Master's and PhDs are pretty different and will lead to different outcomes. I did both - in that, I got a professional Masters, worked for a few years in that field, and now am doing a PhD in a connected field. I don't have a child but am married and a bit older in terms of the other students in the PhD.   I think a Master's (you can pick a 1 or 2 year program) with some sort of scholarship , may work for you. There ARE funded Master's programs. In my experience, they are geared to lead you to interesting jobs in your field of choice, as they typically have career councillors and stuff like that to help you. With a PhD, you are really going to be focusing on academic research, and it can take up to 7 years to finish, meanwhile there is a lot of stress about jobs. I wrote this elsewhere, but I am considering jobs that are less prestigious and well-paying than ones that I got out of my Master's. YMMV, but with a child and being career-focused, an interesting MA or MSc from a decent school will get you far.
Response 28: If you're wanting to go into wildlife biology or a related field... make sure you think about if the kind of work you want to do involves fieldwork. Most grad students in this field do at least some fieldwork which can take them away from home for at least several months a year. Will that be possible for you?  I'm in this field (wildlife biology / ecology / evolution) do at least 4 months of fieldwork a year and because of that I can't even own a dog, let alone have a child. Of course, if you're doing something policy related or something with no fieldwork, that won't be an issue. Also think about what kind of job you want to get out of it. If you want to work for the government or consulting or something like that, probably only a masters is needed, not a PhD.

Response 30: This sounds like your husband is trying to control you by using your kids as leverage.  Finances while completing a PhD have nothing to do with your kid. You're going to be paying rent either way. It sounds to me like your ex just wants to not have to pay you child support if you are making less money than he is. I'm assuming you'll have joint custody, which means that at least part time, you're not going to have your child at home (read: time to manage your studies and get as much done as possible, so you can spend time with kiddo when he/she is there).   Do what you feel is right for your education and career in the long run. Do what feels right for custody of your child for the long run. You can complete a PhD just like a normal job, only maybe with some homework after kiddo goes to bed. Toddlers go to bed early (or they should, anyway) so there is no reason you can't work during the day while kiddo is at daycare and then do any additional studying necessary at night. I completed a master's degree full time while working overtime as a CPA with an infant at home. I did most of my work in the evenings when baby was sleeping.  I am currently working full time, completing a PhD, and have two elementary age kids at home doing schooling due to COVID. You can make this work. Don't let your ex destroy your prospects or take away your kid, that's bullshit.

Response 32: In addition to the in school aspect, the fact that you're interested in wildlife science might be an additional complication.  Field work might be a large demand on your time.  You should probably at least reach out to some grad students and postdocs in programs you're interested in and verify what kinda time demands there are.  And maybe explore a shared custody situation? It doesn't have to be all or nothing.

Response 36: Yes, it is possible. It is hard, but possible. I am currently going through a divorce with a toddler, and I am doctoral student. You do not have to give your husband full custody just because you want to further your career and go to school. Grad school is a lot different than undergrad, and you have a lot more flexibility in terms of dictating the speed at which you finish your degree. Most programs are understanding, it is just a matter of finding a program that fits your needs. The idea that you cannot be a full time parent, and have to relinquish custody of your child is a ploy by your husband.   It is possible. Don’t listen to your husband. Surround yourself with people who believe you and support you.

Response 38: I know this doesn't answer your question and you probably  don't want to hear this but, there are very, very few jobs in wildlife. I run an animal hospital and I'm always getting resumes from people who have spent years at University getting qualifications they hoped would lead to a job with wildlife and it hasn't. These resumes have included ones from people with Masters and PhD's and they are applying for entry level, vet nurse training positions. It makes me so sad. I understand that people feel a passion for wildlife and want a career doing something they love but it doesn't work out for the majority of people. It just leaves them with very limited job skills and a very big debt. Sorry to be a downer but it's a big decision to make and worth considering where it could leave you and just because you could do something doesn't mean you should.
Response 39: Been there, done that, now I’m a Dr. I’m a Dr. w a trillion dollars of student loan debt but I don’t regret any of it!

Response 61: I was a single mom in my Masters program and most of my PhD program. I started graduate school when my son was 5 months old. It was difficult at times but it is possible. I feel that I had better time management and scheduled my time well because I was a single mom. I was able to restrict my work hours to typical M-F 8-5 with some work after he was asleep. When he was a little bigger I’d take him to the coffee shop on the weekend to get a little work done (with activities for him etc).  It was also important that I had very supportive advisors who understood the balance and were kid friendly. I also lucked out and had awesome grad cohorts that didn’t mind my kid tagging along to things so I didn’t feel isolated without social support.  I did, however, have to take out extra student loans to help cover daycare (luckily that was a coverable expense BUT unlucky I’m now in a TON of debt). I think the financial part was more difficult (daycare is stupid expensive in some places), but between the awful loans, crappy stipend, and extra teaching etc, I made it all work.  You can make it work if that’s what you want to do. Be sure that whoever you are going to work with is actually supportive (talk to current and former graduate students if possible).  If you need to do field work, that’s a whole different story. But I know people who’ve made it work.

Response 64: Oh, you can do it and you’ll be fine. It sounds like he’s manipulative and doesn’t know what he’s talking about. As mentioned, you’ll have lots of flexibility in your schedule as a grad student.  My only concern is that wildlife biology/con bio jobs can be ridiculously competitive, especially at the PhD level. It’s a popular field without a ton of demand. So the pay can be low and the competition steep. But, MS level jobs are more abundant and probably more enjoyable for most people who want a mix of being in the field and doing desk work. Just an FYI.

You can ABSOLUTELY do it, and I don’t see a judge removing a child from someones custody just because they are a student? Not in the US at least, if you have a safe home, that’s all that should matter. Is it going to be glamorous? Probably not. But your baby daddy can kick rocks.   Talk to a lawyer just to be sure. I don’t know your specific situation, but him threatening something like that SOUNDS like he plans to WITHHOLD your daughter from you- I know that is something the courts do not like.... just saying.   Good luck mama
Response 70: I was a single mom in my Masters program and most of my PhD program. I started graduate school when my son was 5 months old. It was difficult at times but it is possible. I feel that I had better time management and scheduled my time well because I was a single mom. I was able to restrict my work hours to typical M-F 8-5 with some work after he was asleep. When he was a little bigger I’d take him to the coffee shop on the weekend to get a little work done (with activities for him etc).  It was also important that I had very supportive advisors who understood the balance and were kid friendly. I also lucked out and had awesome grad cohorts that didn’t mind my kid tagging along to things so I didn’t feel isolated without social support.  I did, however, have to take out extra student loans to help cover daycare (luckily that was a coverable expense BUT unlucky I’m now in a TON of debt). I think the financial part was more difficult (daycare is stupid expensive in some places), but between the awful loans, crappy stipend, and extra teaching etc, I made it all work.  You can make it work if that’s what you want to do. Be sure that whoever you are going to work with is actually supportive (talk to current and former graduate students if possible).  If you need to do field work, that’s a whole different story. But I know people who’ve made it work.

Response 74: My mom did her masters as a single parent with me. I am going to go through veterinary school with 3 kids (4,6,8) .
Response 75: One of my best friends in my PhD program was a single mother.  Her kid was maybe 5 at the beginning of the program.  I had another friend finish a PharmD as a single mother of 4 children, though the oldest was a teen so that helped.  So is it possible, yes.  The question really becomes is it possible for you.   Just a little side note, I noticed some people talking about field work at going on long trips.  This really depends on the program and the research group.  We have a wildlife biology program at my school and I know two of the faculty pretty well.  One does take month long trips out of country.  The other studies more local wildlife and they take their boats out in the morning and come back in the afternoon like a regular job.  So you would probably want to consider that when picking a program.   Also, finding a research group lead by a professor that is family friendly is important.  But overall, there is a great deal of flexibility in all academics.  There are groups out there that prioritize getting your work done over face-time in the lab, where you can say my kid is sick so I'm going to work on this data analysis at home today, or I need to leave at 2 today for a doctor visit.  It is hard to know this going into applications, but during interviews, you should start to get a sense and then you should get an opportunity to talk to the other grad students and that is where you really learn about the research group culture.

Response 91: Possible yes, but I dont envy you the task
Response 92: So I’ve recently started taking care of my mom who has dementia, on a postdoc stipend. I think in many ways it’s like taking care of a toddler as a single parent. There’s no one to help around the house at all, no one to shuttle between or schedule endless doctors appointments, no one to provide support in any capacity, just endless need. It is exceedingly difficult to spend the amount t of time I need to spend doing science with these responsibilities.  Someone posted here sometime ago about Ruth Bader Ginsburg saying that having a family forced her to be more deliberate about her working hours. I think if you feel mentally strong and like you have a stable support system you should be able to manage.   Without a support system I can tell you it is exceedingly difficult to meet the demands of the job while being a kind, patient, caring human at home.

Response 105: This sounds like your husband is trying to control you by using your kids as leverage.  Finances while completing a PhD have nothing to do with your kid. You're going to be paying rent either way. It sounds to me like your ex just wants to not have to pay you child support if you are making less money than he is. I'm assuming you'll have joint custody, which means that at least part time, you're not going to have your child at home (read: time to manage your studies and get as much done as possible, so you can spend time with kiddo when he/she is there).   Do what you feel is right for your education and career in the long run. Do what feels right for custody of your child for the long run. You can complete a PhD just like a normal job, only maybe with some homework after kiddo goes to bed. Toddlers go to bed early (or they should, anyway) so there is no reason you can't work during the day while kiddo is at daycare and then do any additional studying necessary at night. I completed a master's degree full time while working overtime as a CPA with an infant at home. I did most of my work in the evenings when baby was sleeping.  I am currently working full time, completing a PhD, and have two elementary age kids at home doing schooling due to COVID. You can make this work. Don't let your ex destroy your prospects or take away your kid, that's bullshit.

Response 108: This is so individual that you'd have to give more information about yourself (which isn't super safe on reddit) and honestly still have to figure it out yourself tbh. Lots of people have families while in the PhD. Lots of people, equally, have no life outside their studies. Some of it is individual, but it also depends on their department, the research they're doing, probably the field...  >  I will have to give him full custody of my daughter because financially and time-wise its not possible.  As in, he's threatening to sue you for full custody if you begin a graduate program? There's not really an environment where you, a legal adult, have to give another legal adult your child outside of a court order. In which case you should probably speak to a lawyer.  The nice thing about grad school is that you have a lot of control over your schedule and where you physically are (although, again, field dependent - if you're an experimentalist or a field scientist, your experiment rules your life and you have to be in the field/in the lab). But, it doesn't pay much (in case of master's, not at all), it's a fair amount of work (def 40 hours+) that requires high concentration and thus is less than ideal to be done while watching a child, not all institutions are fully supportive (and some will pull stunts like take away grad students' health insurance a month before matriculation...), and the life after a PhD is precarious in most fields geographically and income wise.   fwiw not in wildlife science but a few of my college buddies went on to work for national parks and they have just BAs, often in bio but just as often in random stuff like American Studies.

Response 113: Okay. So I studied for an MSc and a PhD and I have a toddler. But I'm not single. After the age of 4, maybe 3, and assuming you do have some help (your parents maybe), and the kid has an 8 to 4 kindergarten, and you have a nice instructor (most in science will not accept it if you leave at 3:30 every day - find one who does), it can be done. The most important thing: after you finish your PhD, if you want an academic career, the clock starts ticking. The period after the terminal degree (PhD) is counted. Many opportunities will be open only for people with X years since the PhD. Women who take a long leave AFTER their PhD regret it. Take it during. No one cares if the PhD took you 3 years or 8 years to finish. It does matter, greatly, how many years pass AFTER the PhD, for many opportunities.

Response 116: Hey, I’ve worked in wildlife research. First, no, of course you don’t need to give your ex full custody if you go to grad school. That’s an absurd statement. Grad school is actually fairly flexible in terms of scheduling, although it is a lot of work. The amount of flexibility you’re ultimately afforded really depends on your advisor, and you should absolutely seek out one who is supportive. Having a good advisor makes all the difference in the world, kid or not. I do know many people who have had children while in grad school. They tend to manage their time extremely closely.   I would also consider looking into non-thesis programs. There are some out there that are designed for working professionals, and I have friends who have done them and gotten great jobs. The downsides are that they won’t include funding (and it’s not cheap) and you’ll be missing out on field experience. The upside is that you won’t be investing the extra time in a thesis or fieldwork. If you go this route, only consider well-regarded programs at reputable universities.   Another thing you could consider if you have the funds would be a GIS certificate. That probably won’t be enough to land you a wildlife job by itself, but it makes you more competitive down the line if you decide to pursue an advanced degree. The downside again is that they’re not funded. Also, sometimes you can get this certificate as part of a graduate degree.   I will say, I’ve loved the wildlife work I’ve done, but it’s challenging. And some of the challenges shouldn’t exist. It’s a competitive field, and lots of people see low or unpaid internships as necessary. I hate that, I think it’s horribly exclusionary, but keep in mind that you’ll be in an applicant pool with undergrads who may have had the privilege of spending several summers doing field research.   As far as the work itself goes, there are often active field seasons. Some labs do their fieldwork locally, but sometimes it’s remote. If you plan to do fieldwork, you’ll obviously have extra logistics to plan around. It’s possible to do, but you will need a support system. And again, a good advisor can work with you on this.   In wildlife research, as is often the case in academia, lots of folks move around. Jobs can be tight and people move to them. That gets harder to do once you have a family. I just want to mention it because I know you’ll be thinking longer term with this. However, you can always look for local, state, and federal jobs. Lots of people don’t stay in academia.   If you have any other questions, please let me know!
Response 117: Not many people have talked about this, but Master's and PhDs are pretty different and will lead to different outcomes. I did both - in that, I got a professional Masters, worked for a few years in that field, and now am doing a PhD in a connected field. I don't have a child but am married and a bit older in terms of the other students in the PhD.   I think a Master's (you can pick a 1 or 2 year program) with some sort of scholarship , may work for you. There ARE funded Master's programs. In my experience, they are geared to lead you to interesting jobs in your field of choice, as they typically have career councillors and stuff like that to help you. With a PhD, you are really going to be focusing on academic research, and it can take up to 7 years to finish, meanwhile there is a lot of stress about jobs. I wrote this elsewhere, but I am considering jobs that are less prestigious and well-paying than ones that I got out of my Master's. YMMV, but with a child and being career-focused, an interesting MA or MSc from a decent school will get you far.

Response 120: Yes, it is possible. It is hard, but possible. I am currently going through a divorce with a toddler, and I am doctoral student. You do not have to give your husband full custody just because you want to further your career and go to school. Grad school is a lot different than undergrad, and you have a lot more flexibility in terms of dictating the speed at which you finish your degree. Most programs are understanding, it is just a matter of finding a program that fits your needs. The idea that you cannot be a full time parent, and have to relinquish custody of your child is a ploy by your husband.   It is possible. Don’t listen to your husband. Surround yourself with people who believe you and support you.
Response 121: Hey, I’ve worked in wildlife research. First, no, of course you don’t need to give your ex full custody if you go to grad school. That’s an absurd statement. Grad school is actually fairly flexible in terms of scheduling, although it is a lot of work. The amount of flexibility you’re ultimately afforded really depends on your advisor, and you should absolutely seek out one who is supportive. Having a good advisor makes all the difference in the world, kid or not. I do know many people who have had children while in grad school. They tend to manage their time extremely closely.   I would also consider looking into non-thesis programs. There are some out there that are designed for working professionals, and I have friends who have done them and gotten great jobs. The downsides are that they won’t include funding (and it’s not cheap) and you’ll be missing out on field experience. The upside is that you won’t be investing the extra time in a thesis or fieldwork. If you go this route, only consider well-regarded programs at reputable universities.   Another thing you could consider if you have the funds would be a GIS certificate. That probably won’t be enough to land you a wildlife job by itself, but it makes you more competitive down the line if you decide to pursue an advanced degree. The downside again is that they’re not funded. Also, sometimes you can get this certificate as part of a graduate degree.   I will say, I’ve loved the wildlife work I’ve done, but it’s challenging. And some of the challenges shouldn’t exist. It’s a competitive field, and lots of people see low or unpaid internships as necessary. I hate that, I think it’s horribly exclusionary, but keep in mind that you’ll be in an applicant pool with undergrads who may have had the privilege of spending several summers doing field research.   As far as the work itself goes, there are often active field seasons. Some labs do their fieldwork locally, but sometimes it’s remote. If you plan to do fieldwork, you’ll obviously have extra logistics to plan around. It’s possible to do, but you will need a support system. And again, a good advisor can work with you on this.   In wildlife research, as is often the case in academia, lots of folks move around. Jobs can be tight and people move to them. That gets harder to do once you have a family. I just want to mention it because I know you’ll be thinking longer term with this. However, you can always look for local, state, and federal jobs. Lots of people don’t stay in academia.   If you have any other questions, please let me know!
Response 122: In addition to the in school aspect, the fact that you're interested in wildlife science might be an additional complication.  Field work might be a large demand on your time.  You should probably at least reach out to some grad students and postdocs in programs you're interested in and verify what kinda time demands there are.  And maybe explore a shared custody situation? It doesn't have to be all or nothing.
Response 123: Really depends on location and support network. Being a single parent is hard but you’d have a consistent stipend and health insurance while a graduate student. I’ve had friends do it
Response 124: This sounds like your husband is trying to control you by using your kids as leverage.  Finances while completing a PhD have nothing to do with your kid. You're going to be paying rent either way. It sounds to me like your ex just wants to not have to pay you child support if you are making less money than he is. I'm assuming you'll have joint custody, which means that at least part time, you're not going to have your child at home (read: time to manage your studies and get as much done as possible, so you can spend time with kiddo when he/she is there).   Do what you feel is right for your education and career in the long run. Do what feels right for custody of your child for the long run. You can complete a PhD just like a normal job, only maybe with some homework after kiddo goes to bed. Toddlers go to bed early (or they should, anyway) so there is no reason you can't work during the day while kiddo is at daycare and then do any additional studying necessary at night. I completed a master's degree full time while working overtime as a CPA with an infant at home. I did most of my work in the evenings when baby was sleeping.  I am currently working full time, completing a PhD, and have two elementary age kids at home doing schooling due to COVID. You can make this work. Don't let your ex destroy your prospects or take away your kid, that's bullshit.

Response 128: I know this doesn't answer your question and you probably  don't want to hear this but, there are very, very few jobs in wildlife. I run an animal hospital and I'm always getting resumes from people who have spent years at University getting qualifications they hoped would lead to a job with wildlife and it hasn't. These resumes have included ones from people with Masters and PhD's and they are applying for entry level, vet nurse training positions. It makes me so sad. I understand that people feel a passion for wildlife and want a career doing something they love but it doesn't work out for the majority of people. It just leaves them with very limited job skills and a very big debt. Sorry to be a downer but it's a big decision to make and worth considering where it could leave you and just because you could do something doesn't mean you should.

Response 131: I’m a single mom. I did my masters while WFH part time as an adjunct at a local community college, with a toddler (he was just over 2.5 when I graduated) alone, most of that during covid, and am planning to start my doctorate when my kiddo goes into 1st grade. It took a lot of pacing/planning, and we had some bad days. But I got creative and made it work. It would have been easier if I had an extra set of hands, but once COVID hit, that wasn’t even an option.  You can ABSOLUTELY do it, and I don’t see a judge removing a child from someones custody just because they are a student? Not in the US at least, if you have a safe home, that’s all that should matter. Is it going to be glamorous? Probably not. But your baby daddy can kick rocks.   Talk to a lawyer just to be sure. I don’t know your specific situation, but him threatening something like that SOUNDS like he plans to WITHHOLD your daughter from you- I know that is something the courts do not like.... just saying.   Good luck mama

You do not have to give your husband full custody just because you want to further your career and go to school.

Response 135: Oh, you can do it and you’ll be fine. It sounds like he’s manipulative and doesn’t know what he’s talking about. As mentioned, you’ll have lots of flexibility in your schedule as a grad student.  My only concern is that wildlife biology/con bio jobs can be ridiculously competitive, especially at the PhD level. It’s a popular field without a ton of demand. So the pay can be low and the competition steep. But, MS level jobs are more abundant and probably more enjoyable for most people who want a mix of being in the field and doing desk work. Just an FYI.

I don’t know your specific situation, but him threatening something like that SOUNDS like he plans to WITHHOLD your daughter from you- I know that is something the courts do not like.... just saying.

Response 157: I’m a single mom. I did my masters while WFH part time as an adjunct at a local community college, with a toddler (he was just over 2.5 when I graduated) alone, most of that during covid, and am planning to start my doctorate when my kiddo goes into 1st grade. It took a lot of pacing/planning, and we had some bad days. But I got creative and made it work. It would have been easier if I had an extra set of hands, but once COVID hit, that wasn’t even an option.

Response 158: Oh, you can do it and you’ll be fine. It sounds like he’s manipulative and doesn’t know what he’s talking about. As mentioned, you’ll have lots of flexibility in your schedule as a grad student.  My only concern is that wildlife biology/con bio jobs can be ridiculously competitive, especially at the PhD level. It’s a popular field without a ton of demand. So the pay can be low and the competition steep. But, MS level jobs are more abundant and probably more enjoyable for most people who want a mix of being in the field and doing desk work. Just an FYI.

Response 162: I was a single mom in my Masters program and most of my PhD program. I started graduate school when my son was 5 months old. It was difficult at times but it is possible. I feel that I had better time management and scheduled my time well because I was a single mom. I was able to restrict my work hours to typical M-F 8-5 with some work after he was asleep. When he was a little bigger I’d take him to the coffee shop on the weekend to get a little work done (with activities for him etc).  It was also important that I had very supportive advisors who understood the balance and were kid friendly. I also lucked out and had awesome grad cohorts that didn’t mind my kid tagging along to things so I didn’t feel isolated without social support.  I did, however, have to take out extra student loans to help cover daycare (luckily that was a coverable expense BUT unlucky I’m now in a TON of debt). I think the financial part was more difficult (daycare is stupid expensive in some places), but between the awful loans, crappy stipend, and extra teaching etc, I made it all work.  You can make it work if that’s what you want to do. Be sure that whoever you are going to work with is actually supportive (talk to current and former graduate students if possible).  If you need to do field work, that’s a whole different story. But I know people who’ve made it work.
Response 163: One of my best friends in my PhD program was a single mother.  Her kid was maybe 5 at the beginning of the program.  I had another friend finish a PharmD as a single mother of 4 children, though the oldest was a teen so that helped.  So is it possible, yes.  The question really becomes is it possible for you.   Just a little side note, I noticed some people talking about field work at going on long trips.  This really depends on the program and the research group.  We have a wildlife biology program at my school and I know two of the faculty pretty well.  One does take month long trips out of country.  The other studies more local wildlife and they take their boats out in the morning and come back in the afternoon like a regular job.  So you would probably want to consider that when picking a program.   Also, finding a research group lead by a professor that is family friendly is important.  But overall, there is a great deal of flexibility in all academics.  There are groups out there that prioritize getting your work done over face-time in the lab, where you can say my kid is sick so I'm going to work on this data analysis at home today, or I need to leave at 2 today for a doctor visit.  It is hard to know this going into applications, but during interviews, you should start to get a sense and then you should get an opportunity to talk to the other grad students and that is where you really learn about the research group culture.
Response 164: Do not ever give up custody. You won’t be spending anymore time then he will working, and no one would ever ask a working father to sacrifice custody time. And in fact, many parents work multiple jobs.

Response 174: I'm a single mum in a masters program, my son is a bit older but I did my bachelor's when he was a toddler and have been in school since. His dad isn't in the picture at all currently.   Your ex doesn't know what he's talking about. Grad school is the same as a full time job. Does he work? Then it's the same. He's trying to threaten / intimidate you it sounds like and you should ignore him.  Depending on where you live, he'll have to pay you support if his income is much higher. Plus many programs (especially PhD) are funded. The main issue you might encounter is geography, as you will need to stay somewhere that is reasonably close to your ex for shared parenting.

I remember a time when I wanted to contribute to a paper in the 'earlier than usual' academic phase (like during a summer project, for example). Though I didn't publish my first paper until 8 months into my PhD. It was my second project that I began to discover where I fit in the field of theoretical physics and published 2 more the next year.  But at such an early stage, papers aren't the most important thing (ironically they are much more important later on in your academic career unfortunately). It is much more important to find where your heart lies in the field of theoretical physics, since it is a very broad discipline. Research becomes a whole lot easier when you are playing to your strengths.  Your best friend right now is arXiv.org \- I would very closely follow hep-ph, hep-th and astro-ph. It is also a great way to find out what particular field in theoretical physics interests you. Read as many as you can and get into a habit of it, arXiv is an indispensable tool for high-energy physicists.
Response 2: The better and more realistic path forward is to start reading up and studying the subject. Take some AP science courses and free community college courses if possible. Find your closest   university and start going to free lectures and events there, particularly if it’s an R1. Make as many connections as you can and look for ways to offset costs to pursue an undergraduate degree in physics or whatever. I am working on a masters (non thesis) and I have a decade of experience in a very niche field. I’ve tried to self publish (what I think is fairly good, very niche research) to journals on that field that have readerships of less than 1,000 usually. I’ve been rejected over and over.

I have already graduated from undergrad and am working a field position this summer. I would like to go to grad school but I didn't do any research during my time as an undergrad. Would it be possible for me to get experience working on any research, even though I'm no longer a student anywhere?","Response 0: Definitely. You can get paid doing it too if you get a position as a lab technician/research assistant. It's common for people to work for a year or two in a research lab before applying for grad school.
Response 1: Yes. I worked as a researcher for a year before grad school.
Response 2: Absolutely, many businesses and their employees actively participate in research and publish papers at conferences and/or in journals.  Without much experience you can be a research assistant, research intern, lab tech, lab assistant, etc.  The issue you'll run into is that you typically need to show some good promise to get in as despite paying under \~30k/yr for all of the above. There is a ton of competition for these roles as they are considered good resume builders.
Response 3: Yes!! Just ask a PI and say you’re interested! They’d love to have an assistant in the lab and to have someone who’s interested join their lab.

Response 6: Do what makes financial sense. My sister is doing just that. She owns a house there. Why would she move? And she knows the job she wants. She’s not a noob and universities are diverse so she does get exposure to differences. It may not be what others think you should do but it had worked out for her. I beebopped around the country and found out what I didn’t want so that is certainly an advantage. But it also is a very lonely experience to move around the country for different programs. It would be very, very lonely during covid. You do what works for you but be smart about it. I think the financial aspect of university programs is often poo pooed / ignored in academia (we are so prestigious lol) but industry could give a flying F. In fact, they will find it impressive usually (in my experience- stem, Ag, tech) they just want solid experience and grit
Response 7: Staying in the same place gives advantage that you know people around. However, from my personal experience you learn more when you change university. Everyone has different working environment and focus on different things. You learn to be more flexible and do not get attach to the place.
Response 8: There is, especially at that last step -- if the department ""trained"" you, then ostensibly you're not brining as much fresh perspective and expertise to the table as would an external candidate.  The only exceptions I've seen have been at especially fancy institutions, e.g. Stanford profs who did ugrad -> PhD -> postdoc all at Stanford.

Response 10: There can be issues. Sometimes there's a concern that the student went to their alma mater because they couldn't get in elsewhere. Other times it's seen as a potential weakness b/c that student wasn't exposed to new ideas. There can be concerns that it's a sign of falling into a rut.  No one single concern is a dealbreaker, but together they're eyebrow-raising. I'd say it's not a huge effect, but I've seen people (literally) raise an eyebrow over it.

Response 14: I'm currently doing so myself and this didn't even occur to me.  I'm autistic, and the change from taught to PhD was hard enough, didn't want to throw in a change of location as well.
Response 15: Responsible doctoral programs will never admit you if you haven't studied at another school for either a bachelor's or master's. You simply need a broader perspective than you can get at one school.  Anyone who speaks of a specific school as the one where they intend to teach immediately outs themselves as being absurdly naive. When it's time to apply for faculty positions, if you aren't applying in all 24 time zones, you aren't really trying.

29,I’m writing a scientific review paper and I can’t get started with writing. 😩 I’m writing a scientific review paper and I can’t get started with writing. I’ve done the research but I can’t get over a mental block to start writing. Any helpful hints out there?,"Response 0: Sit down with the attitude that you will write the shittiest shit ever to be shat, but you will start hitting keys and do it now. Zero expectations high word count. Edit later.
Response 1: 1) Just get something down on the page, it doesn't matter if it's rubbish. It's much easier to re-work a written paper than it is to write it for the first time.  2) To start off, you don't even need to write complete paragraphs. I like to just write a note at the top of each paragraph that's like the ""headline point"" that the paragraph will make. Then, I can write a little bit and leave it if I get stuck, and I still know what the paragraph is trying to do, and how it should link to the next paragraph. I do it by writing the headlines in square brackets at the top of each paragraph.
Response 2: Reviews suck.  I've written 3 or 4.  My advice?   Write an outline.  Just bulleted list of topics and ideas you want to cover.  Then start fleshing out those topics with appropriate references.  After that, it's just fluff and connectors.
Response 3: 1) Just get something down on the page, it doesn't matter if it's rubbish. It's much easier to re-work a written paper than it is to write it for the first time.  2) To start off, you don't even need to write complete paragraphs.

Response 4: I have never had this issue and I think it comes down to the fact that I never judge my writing.  That is why you edit.  But writing should lack judgement.  A first draft should be embarrassing in retrospect and almost certainly lack brilliance.  But you will clarify your thoughts, clear out all the non-sense, and stumble upon brilliance along the way.  Here is what I would do;   1) Create an outline with the main points; ""A has been found to cause B, B has been found to cause C, therefore A causes C.""  Sometimes it helps to draw these arguments as figures.  At least for me. 2) Then fill in the studies that justify these statements.   3) After that, literally describe the arguments in a stream-of-conscious style of writing.  You'll throw away 95% of what you wrote, but that is the point.   4) Edit for clarity and conciseness.  Re-write.  Edit again.  Re-write.  Edit again.  Etc, etc.    Good luck!
Response 5: Sit down with the attitude that you will write the shittiest shit ever to be shat, but you will start hitting keys and do it now. Zero expectations high word count. Edit later.
Response 6: When I get stuck, I shop around for papers written on a similar topic and see how they started. Then I ""try it on"" -- I adopt a similar approach to introducing the topic, and see how it ""feels"" to write from there. Eventually I get a sense of what feels right to me as a starting point and at that point I've found my voice.
Response 7: I agree with the outline bit which I like to do on paper at first. Then I can see the general flow of my argument. And I can draw boxes and arrows. Then I like to note which papers go into which section. Then you can, like someone else said, write a bit about each paper. Then rearrange into a full proper paragraph.   But I'm a big believer in the first draft is total garbage mindset. When I'm been really stuck I've sat there and hurriedly written the first garbled sentence that comes to me. Editing is easier so just get your crazy thought down first then slowly craft them into interesting words.   Or, distract yourself and type/organize your references and properly paginate like type in the section headers in the right font.  Best of luck

Response 10: Instead of ‘writing’ i find it helpful to just ‘talk to the paper’.   I do this by just writing the headings and first sentences of the paragraphs and say stuff like ‘here i need to show that there is a lot of evidence for y’s impact on z.’   Quite often this results in me becoming a bit hyperfocused and I’ll start filling in the blanks. So an unintened but wonderful side effect of me just trying to write a rough outline, is I end up with big chunks of new text.

Response 14: I’d reflect on WHY you are writing this review. What is it you hope to achieve when it has been written? What lesson is it meant to convey? I think you start very simply by writing the reason for why this review is worth reading. Just make it as straight forward a task as possible. Then, build incrementally.

Response 16: For a review I'd say write down the take away message(s) of each of the papers you think should be cited in your review, then cluster those by broader topic (which would correspond to subsections), and in each cluster sort chronologically or otherwise logically, and then fix grammar and narrative.

Response 18: I've had this argument a number of times (here and elsewhere) and it always seems to generate pushback, but here goes:  Graduate students probably shouldn't spend their time writing review papers. Yes, reviewing the literature is important/necessary for a PhD. And yes, it is common to have a dissertation chapter that is essentially a review of your subfield. However, with few exceptions, graduate students generally do not have the experience to write substantive reviews.   Writing good reviews is extremely difficult, and is something that seasoned full professors frequently struggle with. It is *far* more than just searching Web of Science/Google Scholar for a few weeks;  not only do you need to have read and be largely familiar with dozens if not hundreds of papers, you should have a good understanding of the history of the field, the history of the people involved in the field, what worked and what hasn't worked and why, what debates were had and resolved/left unresolved, what related disciplines are doing, and what is being worked on/getting funded *right now*. And that's before you even get started writing your novel synthesis.  More and more I see early career professors telling their 1st year graduate students to get started by writing a review of their field for publication. As if such a monumental task makes any sense to assign to someone just starting out. Sure, some students write decent reviews and yes, some of them even get these reviews published (though often on the backs of their supervisors). But I wish it would stop being the default advice given to early career scientists/academics.

30,"PhD students: How do you manage to do your daily chores with such long hours? How does your daily routine look like? Non-native English speaker here.   I keep on reading here that PhD students work for 11-13 hour workdays.   My question is, give the high work hours how do you manage to do other daily chores that are a requirement of life. For example how do you manage to:   * Cook  * Shopping for groceries.   * Clean home, laundry  * Personal grooming: Thorough bath, skin care regimes  * Exercise: You need at least an hour and a half for exercise and recuperation.   * Maintaining a pet: if you have one.   * Making repairs: Fixing your car, home, gadgets etc.   * Maintaining relationships: Like calling parents, friends to find out how they are etc.   * Caring for someone sick: If you are in that circumstance.   * Do chores that can only be done during work hours: eg going to the post office, government offices, banks, doctor's visits, mechanic's visit to your house and so on.   * Other chores that are skipping me at the moment.   PS: I am asking because I am out of home from 8am to 9:30pm. I can't even brush my teeth or shampoo properly given the time even though I have my food, lunches prepared and home and other chores maintained. It sounds impossible that other people are doing so much with a more constrained time than me. I want to do a PhD and I don't know if it will even be possible to do the chores listed above if I can't do them now. So I am looking for inspiration for time management.","Response 0: Tl;dr: If you're working every day, 12 hours a day in a PhD program, you're doing it wrong or you're in a toxic lab.  I'm a PhD student in a Pharmacology program.  I don't work 12 hours a day.  I work closer to 7-9 hours during the week and pick up a couple of hours on the weekend if I need to for experiments/deadlines.  On average, I work 40-50 hours a week.  A weekday for me would look something like this (no classes):  * 6:15 AM: wake up, get ready (hair, makeup, feed cat, etc), brush teeth, check the weather, eat a light breakfast like cereal * 7:45-8:15 AM: arrive to lab, look at my list of duties and calendar, plan my day, work, read, etc * 4:45-6:15 PM: get home, this varies depending on my workday * 4:50 PM: Go for a jog (~3-4 miles, 30 minutes) * 5:30 PM: shower/meal prep * 6:00 PM: dinner and netflix/hulu/TV * 7:00 PM: feed and love cat/clean up/dishes/start laundry/grocery shop/etc * 8:00 PM: check e-mail/read/free-time * 10-11 PM: sleep  There is a lot that can vary in this schedule in the evening for me based on my needs.  I have a lot of time to spend to grocery shop, run errands, do laundry, clean, maintain personal hygeine, etc.  Honestly, you just have to make time for chores and the other things on your list like any other working adult.  Some tips I have that make my life easier:  * The slow cooker is one of my best friends for cooking.  I'll throw in some meat with seasoning in the morning on low, come home, shred it, chop up some veggies I picked up from the store the night before, and I have some easy meat and veggies for tacos or a rice bowl.  I make a bunch so I have leftovers to freeze or refridgerate. * If you have trouble picking out clothing or getting ready in the morning, set out your clothes the night before * When you're at work, spending time working.  Oftentimes, if I hear of a PhD spending 12-14 hours a day in the laboratory, I can almost guarantee that person is not constantly working while they are there or their advisor is a jerk.  Take breaks, sure, but set out your tasks ahead of time and work to get them done. * Planning a schedule or writing down my work tasks for a day helps me manage my time at work better than just keeping a mental note of all the things I need to do. * No one tracks my hours so if I need to step out to go to the post office or to a dr's appointment during the day I can.  No one gets upset at me.  Just make time for those things. * For a pet, I have a cat.  My cat does a pretty good job at maintaining herself without me there all the time.  I feed her in the morning, feed her at night, clean her litter box, and spend some time with her.  She doesn't need constant monitoring, she's a pretty low maintenance pet to have.  I know students who have dogs and they make it work.
Response 1: I just lived in filth. #noshame
Response 2: I just lived in filth. #noshame
Response 3: I'm a PhD student in biomedical sciences.  I have to echo what others are saying - 11-13 hour workdays are excessive. Of course, there are always times you'll have to work long hours, but consistently working that much will lead to a very real burnout.  Realistically I work 8-10 hour days regularly. Balancing life and grad school is always a challenge, but it is absolutely possible. I changed my schedule around a lot until I found a system that worked for me, for example, I get up early and go to the gym. This way I get my workout in (which is also key for managing my mental health!) and then I'm far more productive when I get to lab since I've been up for hours. Because of that, I can usually finish all my wet lab work and most computer work at a reasonable time. Get home, make dinner, relax. Taking this time to unwind from the day is just as important as working; it will increase your productivity and keep you from burning out.  As far as errands and what not go, take them in chunks. Car maintenance can often be done on the weekend, so set aside a Saturday morning and go get it done. I'm fairly lucky that I work in a lab that's independent and laid-back, so if I have to run to the bank in the middle of the day, no one cares. If you cannot do this, go during lunch.  As for grocery shopping, we take advantage of the online ordering and pickup services, like from Walmart, where pickup is free. Not only do we save money from not perusing every aisle and buying on a whim, but we also only spend 30 minutes running to pick up our groceries vs hours otherwise.   But honestly, take a moment to re-evaluate working 11-13 hour days. This is excessive, regardless of the reason. Making time to do other things in life is essential, and there's no reason to be working so much (unless, as others have stated it's a toxic environment).
Response 4: The worst I ever had was two weeks when I slept in the lab. That was certainly not my norm - I had several months worth of 4-5 hour 'workdays', in that I only needed to be in the lab for a morning or evening. But yeah, wet lab bioscience had a lot of nasty weeks.  I couldn't have done it without:  * A supportive partner (in the same division, so we were often in the lab overnight together). * Grocery delivery services. We're in the UK, and Ocado and Sainsbury's was amazing. * Tolerance. We generally spent one day every week (or fortnight, urgh) just catching up with everything. That meant tolerating dirty sheets, piling laundry and washing up. * Cover. When we got our cat, we made sure one of us would be home at a reasonable hour every day.  Yeah, I absolutely put relationships on the back burner - but that's not uncommon for people at this age, as friends move away. A lot of my mates were busy with other work anyway, esp. medics or lawyers. Post-PhD I've successfully reconnected with a bunch of them.  With perfect hindsight, it was largely worth living that life - but I wouldn't do it again.
Response 5: PhD student in Public Health here. The short answer: get up early, make efficient use of 15 minute gaps in schedule, rely on my partner too much, be comfortable with prioritizing and letting things slide, be comfortable with feeling a little guilty, and double dip whenever possible.  Long answer:  When I wake up early (5 or 6am) I can do so much more. It doesn’t always happen but when it does it’s a ducking productive day  Make efficient use of 15 min gaps. Know how to meal prep in that amount of time. Cook foods that can easily be eaten for dinner then thrown into different arrangements for easy lunches in the week. For example, bell pepper, onion, and steak/chicken/shrimp fajitas can be cooked on a sheet pan in oven (while studying) and leftovers can be thrown over a handful of greens with leftover sauce or half a lemon as salad dressing for several lunch meals in the week. Get familiar with staples that allow for this: fish, steak, and chicken dinners thrown over boxed greens for lunches. 15 mins is also enough time to sort and start a load of laundry or fold a load of clothes. Also enough time to get through half a sink of dishes. Don’t discount small pockets of time. Know what you can do in small gaps you’ll find here and there and be motivated to make use of them  Relying on others. I rely on my partner, I help more with chores and cooking during the weekend and I rely on him during the crazy study week. He was in grad school before so he gets it, now he’s in industry and has a nice schedule. Give your partner lots of love to make up for leaning on him/her! :)  Get comfortable with knowing that things won’t get done and prioritizing what can wait until the next day. Part of that you’ll feel guilty for but understand it’s inevitable. Sometimes even deadlines have to slide a little. Align yourself with realistic individuals that understand this if you can. If not, make your own personal “I can let this slide” list. I love the gym at school but if I don’t have time, I can save 30 Mins by using the baby gym at my apartment complex when I first wake up. Are you a girl? There are days where hairspray and a ponytail are a must; sounds gross but sometimes dry shampoo has to cut it. I’d rather get a workout in and a quick rinse than actually shampoo and dry my hair. Weird priorities have to be made on crazy days. Not all days will be this crazy! If they are then you’re in the wrong lab/advisor/program   Double dip and use your resources. Enough said.  Good luck, OP! Hope this helps in some small way:)
Response 6: I'm not a PhD student, but I'm a PI and I was a student once. You should not have to work (on average) more than 8-9 hours per day. I think there are issues here about setting realistic expectations (given an average 40 hour work week) with regards to your work and communicating them to your supervisor. No one wants you to work 11-13 hours per day - it's not healthy and not sustainable in the long run.   There is a possibility that you are in a toxic workplace or have a bad supervisor, but you didn't really talk about that aspect so I'll assume for now that is not the case.   The most important thing is to sit with your supervisor and come up with a list of realistic expectations and be clear about how long you think each task will take. I do this with new PhD students and new postdocs each week. You can also provide regular updates for your supervisor so they know there's movement on your tasks, and modify these expectations based on new information.   Keep in mind this is not a challenge unique to academic workplaces, but also in industry.

Response 8: I'm at end of my PhD, so grinding for job interviews and finishing up writing is my life right now.  In short, I eat out twice a day. Before this, I was getting a produce box delivered to my house once a week, and meal prepped. The produce box was actually significantly cheaper than my local grocery store, so it was a no-brainer. Fortunately because of job interviews, a lot of my meals are getting comped.  I do laundry a few times a week because I work out a lot, and I basically let it run while I'm working at home. The clean laundry lives in the hamper unless I'm bored and feel like folding it.

With perfect hindsight, it was largely worth living that life - but I wouldn't do it again.
Response 10: The answer to this varies based on where you fall in the PhD sequence, and on how rigorous your program is. It is not static. Why? Because the constraints, demands, and obligations that you deal with throughout the process are not static. I get the sense that most people responding here are either in programs with little coursework requirements or are later on in their sequences-- that is, responding from the stage at which they've already done qualifying exams and are not being forced to take a full courseload along with doing research. Post-quals/post advancement to candidacy = a generally more flexible stage that allows you to get marginally closer to a semi-normal home life. (Emphasis on ""marginally."")  &#x200B;  If we're talking about the first third or half of the PhD, my answer (coming from a very rigorous R1 program) is the following: you manage only a couple of things you've listed above, only barely, and if you're lucky. Many of them might happen only sporadically. If you have a partner living with you to help you, you might be better off. You will have very little time for these mundane things. The first few years of the PhD are like a time warp.  &#x200B;  If you're in your first few years and have a full set of graduate courses (e.g. 4 per semester, in my case) you simply don't have time. I spent my first year under such a heavy reading and workload that I was living on about 4-5 hours of sleep for the whole year; I wasn't going out, was constantly turning down hangouts with friends, had to tell people that I didn't have time to date. At all. And even then, I still wasn't getting all of the reading done. Sometimes I'd get all of my reading done but had gotten so little sleep that I couldn't always remember details immediately when being questioned on the spot...which got me accusations from my advisor of not doing the readings (yeah, I was angry. Asshole). I was pretty burnt out by the end of that year, unsurprisingly. It felt like academic hazing. And truthfully, I think it kind of was. It wasn't healthy, wasn't sustainable, wasn't reasonable or right. I could barely take care of basics like laundry (and even now, I still go a while without it sometimes, as life is still a whirlwind and I have qualifying exams in two weeks and feel way underprepared-- really hard to justify more time wasted).  &#x200B;  One thing that I realized by the end of that year is that there is truly **never** enough time, and every choice is a sacrifice. Whatever I choose to read, I'm choosing over another thing that I'm supposed to read. Whatever I choose to do is further sacrificing getting things done, no matter what. So you have to prioritize things that you'll get into tangible trouble for if you don't complete them. One example: do I wash my sheets and make my bed properly for the first time in months, or do I read and finish a paper that I need to present on in two hours? Every day, ad infinitum, because the obligations like this are just repeated every week. I realized that I had to choose explicitly to *not* complete some of my work in order to do things like go out for dinner or have any semblance of a social life, maintain basic friendships, etc. I had to cut out all extra work that I could possibly get away with not doing, and it still adds up to a lot. I'm slightly more balanced now but still find it hard to complete a lot of the things you've listed.  &#x200B;  Pro tips I've learned personally or from others over time:  * If you have the money, automated delivery services for groceries, toiletries, or ready-made meals really help. * Get used to being able to spare only 15 minutes for a quick run in the morning, at best. Often you might not be able to do so at all. * Living with or dating a normie/non-academic with an average work-life balance will make ""life maintenance"" logistics easier at home. * But at the same time, non-academics often find it hard to deal with our schedules and might become frustrated or resentful-- I'm not sure whether I'd be able to relate as well to a partner outside of academia at this point. My current partner is also an academic (with an equally terrible schedule) and I am virtually certain that this is the only reason I'm able to maintain it.
Response 11: Things I did during grad school:  - Cook (Occasionally, usually in bulk to set up multiple meals)  - Shopping for groceries (Lived in an urban area, shop was a couple min walk from home, was easy to swing by the shop on my return home from work)  - Clean home, laundry (Once/week, usually Sat or Sun morning)  - Personal grooming: Thorough bath, skin care regimes (This was reduced to a bare minimum)    Things I did not do during grad school:  - Exercise: You need at least an hour and a half for exercise and recuperation  - Maintaining a pet: if you have one.  - Making repairs: Fixing your car, home, gadgets etc.  - Maintaining relationships: Like calling parents, friends to find out how they are etc.  - Caring for someone sick: If you are in that circumstance.  - Do chores that can only be done during work hours: eg going to the post office, government offices, banks, doctor's visits, mechanic's visit to your house and so on    It was a long seven years, and terrible for my mental and physical health. 2/5 would not recommend.

Response 16: The worst I ever had was two weeks when I slept in the lab. That was certainly not my norm - I had several months worth of 4-5 hour 'workdays', in that I only needed to be in the lab for a morning or evening. But yeah, wet lab bioscience had a lot of nasty weeks.  I couldn't have done it without:  * A supportive partner (in the same division, so we were often in the lab overnight together). * Grocery delivery services. We're in the UK, and Ocado and Sainsbury's was amazing. * Tolerance. We generally spent one day every week (or fortnight, urgh) just catching up with everything. That meant tolerating dirty sheets, piling laundry and washing up. * Cover. When we got our cat, we made sure one of us would be home at a reasonable hour every day.  Yeah, I absolutely put relationships on the back burner - but that's not uncommon for people at this age, as friends move away.

Response 17: I absolutely do not work that much, and I think you would be hard pressed to find many that do. But, I do a few key things for managing normal life things while in my PhD. I do all my chores, cooking, shopping, etc. on the weekend and try to get them done as fast as possible. I cook 1 dish per week for dinner and one dish a week for lunch then eat the same food all week (not everyone loves it but it works ok for me). I do have a cat, so pretty low maintenance,  but I work at home a lot so I have plenty of time to spend with him. I go through waves where I am great at exercising regularly, other times not so much.

Response 19: I meal prep on the weekends, cook a ton of food.  Cleaning and laundry are on Sundays.  I'm lucky that I have a fenced yard and dog door so the dog takes herself out. Low maintenance. On my 12+ hour days I have a dog walker come.  Exercise is 3x a week about an hour each time, only strength training. Usually one session on the weekends and the others sometime in the week, usually Tuesday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday.  Fixing the house is up to the landlord... take the car to the shop.  Maintaining relationships usually happens while studying/working/writing. I'm not close with my family. I see my partner every other day or so, depending on how busy each of us are.  Errands that need to be done during work hours I do the same as anyone else. Take time off work.  I shower when I wake up and before I go to bed. Brush teeth and do skin care around the shower. The whole routine takes 30 minutes max. On the days when I'm out of the house the hours you are, I shower/personal hygiene from 6:30 to 7 and leave the house around 7:15 to get to work/school by 8. Get home, shower at 10 and in bed by 10:30.  Time management in general: get off your computer, get off your phone, get off Reddit, don't watch TV, etc etc.

Response 22: I don’t.  I order my groceries delivered. I split with my flatnate for a cleaner every few weeks. I bulk cook and catch up with the necessary chores on weekends, have no beauty regime before being clean, and don’t get any exercise outside of my cycle to work.
Response 23: PhD student in Public Health here. The short answer: get up early, make efficient use of 15 minute gaps in schedule, rely on my partner too much, be comfortable with prioritizing and letting things slide, be comfortable with feeling a little guilty, and double dip whenever possible.  Long answer:  When I wake up early (5 or 6am) I can do so much more. It doesn’t always happen but when it does it’s a ducking productive day  Make efficient use of 15 min gaps. Know how to meal prep in that amount of time. Cook foods that can easily be eaten for dinner then thrown into different arrangements for easy lunches in the week. For example, bell pepper, onion, and steak/chicken/shrimp fajitas can be cooked on a sheet pan in oven (while studying) and leftovers can be thrown over a handful of greens with leftover sauce or half a lemon as salad dressing for several lunch meals in the week. Get familiar with staples that allow for this: fish, steak, and chicken dinners thrown over boxed greens for lunches. 15 mins is also enough time to sort and start a load of laundry or fold a load of clothes. Also enough time to get through half a sink of dishes. Don’t discount small pockets of time. Know what you can do in small gaps you’ll find here and there and be motivated to make use of them  Relying on others. I rely on my partner, I help more with chores and cooking during the weekend and I rely on him during the crazy study week. He was in grad school before so he gets it, now he’s in industry and has a nice schedule. Give your partner lots of love to make up for leaning on him/her! :)  Get comfortable with knowing that things won’t get done and prioritizing what can wait until the next day. Part of that you’ll feel guilty for but understand it’s inevitable. Sometimes even deadlines have to slide a little. Align yourself with realistic individuals that understand this if you can. If not, make your own personal “I can let this slide” list. I love the gym at school but if I don’t have time, I can save 30 Mins by using the baby gym at my apartment complex when I first wake up. Are you a girl? There are days where hairspray and a ponytail are a must; sounds gross but sometimes dry shampoo has to cut it. I’d rather get a workout in and a quick rinse than actually shampoo and dry my hair. Weird priorities have to be made on crazy days. Not all days will be this crazy! If they are then you’re in the wrong lab/advisor/program   Double dip and use your resources. Enough said.  Good luck, OP! Hope this helps in some small way:)

Response 26: Do not spend that much time working. You are going to be evaluated on what you produce, not the hours you spend producing it. I've seen too many grad students and postdocs think that if that light in their office is on morning to night, the adviser will appreciate all their hard work. But I've seen those students work - they go at a snail's pace. I remember painfully watching a labmate spend 4 hours putting together a conference presentation in the hotel room at the last minute. I can get one with the same quality put together in 30min. The key is to get good at what you do, and do it efficiently.
Response 27: I am a PhD student with 2 kids. Here is my schedule which I tweak every semester based on responsibilities.  Mon - Sat:  8: Wake up  8-10:30: family time, grooming, I skip breakfasts  10:30: Leave to work; I intentionally refer to school/lab/research as ""work"" to help me separate it from personal life.   11:30: Work starts  2: Protein shake and almonds while working  16-18: Gym or physical therapy or Skype with my family  21-22: Reply to emails, pay bills, order groceries online, have a snack, etc. or play video games for an hour.  22: Leave work, watch Netflix, listen to podcasts, or read a book while on the bus  23: dinner and meditate or just relax  Bed: 23:30   Sun: All day with my family, meal prep for the whole week (InstantPot FTW!), zero work.  This is about 45 hours of pure work a week. If I work more, I lose focus.    What really helps are various time saving tricks I have learned, e.g., doing scheduling and email during low priority but obligatory meetings or seminars, avoiding meetings when possible, blocking off time on my calendar instead of merely using a to-do list, taking care of your body to avoid losing time on being sick or injured or depressed, etc.
Response 28: Anyone who's here doing a PhD in CS? I wish I could work 8 hours, mostly working 10-12 hours these days. :|
Response 29: I'm at end of my PhD, so grinding for job interviews and finishing up writing is my life right now.  In short, I eat out twice a day. Before this, I was getting a produce box delivered to my house once a week, and meal prepped. The produce box was actually significantly cheaper than my local grocery store, so it was a no-brainer. Fortunately because of job interviews, a lot of my meals are getting comped.  I do laundry a few times a week because I work out a lot, and I basically let it run while I'm working at home. The clean laundry lives in the hamper unless I'm bored and feel like folding it.

Errands that need to be done during work hours I do the same as anyone else. Take time off work.  I shower when I wake up and before I go to bed. Brush teeth and do skin care around the shower. The whole routine takes 30 minutes max. On the days when I'm out of the house the hours you are, I shower/personal hygiene from 6:30 to 7 and leave the house around 7:15 to get to work/school by 8. Get home, shower at 10 and in bed by 10:30.  Time management in general: get off your computer, get off your phone, get off Reddit, don't watch TV, etc etc.
Response 31: Things I did during grad school:  - Cook (Occasionally, usually in bulk to set up multiple meals)  - Shopping for groceries (Lived in an urban area, shop was a couple min walk from home, was easy to swing by the shop on my return home from work)  - Clean home, laundry (Once/week, usually Sat or Sun morning)  - Personal grooming: Thorough bath, skin care regimes (This was reduced to a bare minimum)    Things I did not do during grad school:  - Exercise: You need at least an hour and a half for exercise and recuperation  - Maintaining a pet: if you have one.  - Making repairs: Fixing your car, home, gadgets etc.  - Maintaining relationships: Like calling parents, friends to find out how they are etc.  - Caring for someone sick: If you are in that circumstance.  - Do chores that can only be done during work hours: eg going to the post office, government offices, banks, doctor's visits, mechanic's visit to your house and so on    It was a long seven years, and terrible for my mental and physical health. 2/5 would not recommend.

Response 35: I meal prep on the weekends, cook a ton of food.  Cleaning and laundry are on Sundays.  I'm lucky that I have a fenced yard and dog door so the dog takes herself out. Low maintenance. On my 12+ hour days I have a dog walker come.  Exercise is 3x a week about an hour each time, only strength training. Usually one session on the weekends and the others sometime in the week, usually Tuesday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday.  Fixing the house is up to the landlord... take the car to the shop.

Response 37: I'm at end of my PhD, so grinding for job interviews and finishing up writing is my life right now.  In short, I eat out twice a day. Before this, I was getting a produce box delivered to my house once a week, and meal prepped. The produce box was actually significantly cheaper than my local grocery store, so it was a no-brainer. Fortunately because of job interviews, a lot of my meals are getting comped.  I do laundry a few times a week because I work out a lot, and I basically let it run while I'm working at home. The clean laundry lives in the hamper unless I'm bored and feel like folding it.
Response 38: I am a PhD student with 2 kids. Here is my schedule which I tweak every semester based on responsibilities.  Mon - Sat:  8: Wake up  8-10:30: family time, grooming, I skip breakfasts  10:30: Leave to work; I intentionally refer to school/lab/research as ""work"" to help me separate it from personal life.   11:30: Work starts  2: Protein shake and almonds while working  16-18: Gym or physical therapy or Skype with my family  21-22: Reply to emails, pay bills, order groceries online, have a snack, etc. or play video games for an hour.  22: Leave work, watch Netflix, listen to podcasts, or read a book while on the bus  23: dinner and meditate or just relax  Bed: 23:30   Sun: All day with my family, meal prep for the whole week (InstantPot FTW!), zero work.  This is about 45 hours of pure work a week. If I work more, I lose focus.    What really helps are various time saving tricks I have learned, e.g., doing scheduling and email during low priority but obligatory meetings or seminars, avoiding meetings when possible, blocking off time on my calendar instead of merely using a to-do list, taking care of your body to avoid losing time on being sick or injured or depressed, etc.
Response 39: This will vary a lot based on field of study, but one thing to keep in mind is that even though PhD programs can be a lot of work, there is often going to be a fair amount of flexibility in terms of how you put your hours in, and for that matter, you should probably be taking short breaks every once in a while too.  I did my PhD in a humanities field, and while there are some things that take place on fixed schedules and locations (taking courses while you're in the coursework phase, teaching courses, holding office hours), those things are typically going to be the minority of your work time. Most of my time was occupied with things like writing, marking my students' essays, and reading/taking notes on things.  A repairman coming by the house to fix something? I'll just make sure that I have a pile of grading at home that I can work on until he shows up and while he's there. Need to stop by the bank? Use it as an opportunity to stretch your legs after you've been doing research for two hours in the library. A PhD is a lot of work, but the work is much more flexible than other types of jobs. Your schedule is more likely to be almost entirely self-motivated outside of your teaching. A lot depends on your ability to work efficiently and productively. I had a friend who did her PhD in astrophysics, and her approach was basically to work as hard and efficiently as possible from 8 to 5 every day, and my impression of her life was that she rarely did PhD work outside of those hours except from in the last semester when she was finishing everything up. It can definitely be done, but many people simply don't work efficiently.
Response 40: No I don't work 11-13 hours a day, only 7-8 hours. For sure there are certain days I have to work 12 hours at least but it's rare. For reference, I'm in a wet lab.

No I'm not hardworking enough to meal prep, I eat discounted sushi :) * 11 - shower, get the laundry going for the smelly gym clothes; let the rats run loose while I clean their cage, play with them, watch tv at the same time * 1230 - sleep  This are my mondays, wednesdays and thursdays. Tuesdays and Thursdays I go out for dinner with friends or just head home to do nothing. On Saturdays, depending on my social calendar, I would go out in the day with friends or family or I stay home to clean, and go horseback riding in the evening. On Sundays, I go to church in the late morning, then have lunch with friends and head back to the lab to prepare for Monday. I suppose the one thing that I don't do is meal prep, which I think takes enormous amounts of time. I'm lucky that there's a lot of convenient and cheap food options even late at night.

Response 43: Dude, people don't work that much. If some guy is on reddit saying ""I work 13 hours a day"", my response is ""the 5 hours you spend per day on reddit in your office are not work"".  If you come in for an 8-9 hour workday and you actually WORK that time, which is like take a lunch or 2 shorter breaks but spend the rest of the time doing your shit not procrastinating or doing pretend work, you will be more productive than average.
Response 44: Not a PhD student myself but one of my instructors is a PhD student from the Netherlands, and he has a newborn baby. I always wonder how he manages to be a father and a husband while juggling everything that’s required of him as a PhD student.

Response 48: I don’t.  I order my groceries delivered. I split with my flatnate for a cleaner every few weeks. I bulk cook and catch up with the necessary chores on weekends, have no beauty regime before being clean, and don’t get any exercise outside of my cycle to work.

Response 59: For a lot of these, it's just about getting good at time management and developing consistency. Learn to set boundaries, 11-13 hour workdays are excessive and you're not realistically getting 50% extra work done compared to 8 hour work days. Like any job, there will be weeks where you have downtime and weeks where you need to kick into overdrive for crunchtime. You have to actively reach out to people if you want to stay in touch, but realistically my friends and family know that maybe we'll only really talk biweekly, or mostly chat online or something. Repairs and whatnot are generally not a constant drain on time.  I shop once a week, do laundry once a week or every other week, clean every other week or so, and do dishes daily. An hour and a half for exercise every day is *a ton,* at that point you could safely raise the intensity and decrease the duration for a more effective workout. And people do rotations for a reason.  As a PhD student, your hours are very flexible- you need to put in work, a lot of people like to keep a schedule i.e. I try to be in lab from 9:30 to 6, not counting class times. But you can also much more easily dip out to go to the bank in the middle of the day if needed. Some people have biology experiments/protocols that require 4 hours in between steps, so it's not like you can't knock out other stuff during that time. I don't have a pet. I have to care for sick family members, but in my situation that's mostly a commitment I can stick to on weekends- other people may not have that luxury.

Response 61: Crank out weekly errands and chores on Sunday and work out in the mornings on campus, shower and change at the gym then come into work.   You really got to talk to your PI and put your foot down, 12 hour days are not sustainable, as you've found in writing your bullet points.  You will be waaaay more productive working something closer to 9-5, being very rigid about getting 8 hours of sleep, and taking care of your needs. For example, my PI works 7 to ~2-3 and catches up on reading or writing at home on Tuesdays.   Book up your Saturdays for fun activities, you will work a lot more efficiently during the week if you have a fun thing to look forward to. Never give yourself more than a few hours of on-campus work during the weekends, but don't make a habit of it, it's the fastest way to sap your soul and kill your spirit.
Response 62: I don't think anyone is working 11-13 hours everyday in their PhD. However, the fact that it gets to the point that there is constant crunchtime where people will have to work 10-12 hour days for a week or two every couple of months, and then go back to STILL working 40-45 hours a week after crunchtime, is the more common problem (along with the fact that this is seen as normal/""deal with it"")
Response 63: I'm not a PhD student, but I'm a PI and I was a student once. You should not have to work (on average) more than 8-9 hours per day. I think there are issues here about setting realistic expectations (given an average 40 hour work week) with regards to your work and communicating them to your supervisor. No one wants you to work 11-13 hours per day - it's not healthy and not sustainable in the long run.   There is a possibility that you are in a toxic workplace or have a bad supervisor, but you didn't really talk about that aspect so I'll assume for now that is not the case.   The most important thing is to sit with your supervisor and come up with a list of realistic expectations and be clear about how long you think each task will take. I do this with new PhD students and new postdocs each week. You can also provide regular updates for your supervisor so they know there's movement on your tasks, and modify these expectations based on new information.   Keep in mind this is not a challenge unique to academic workplaces, but also in industry.

Response 65: Do not spend that much time working. You are going to be evaluated on what you produce, not the hours you spend producing it. I've seen too many grad students and postdocs think that if that light in their office is on morning to night, the adviser will appreciate all their hard work. But I've seen those students work - they go at a snail's pace. I remember painfully watching a labmate spend 4 hours putting together a conference presentation in the hotel room at the last minute. I can get one with the same quality put together in 30min. The key is to get good at what you do, and do it efficiently.

I think there are issues here about setting realistic expectations (given an average 40 hour work week) with regards to your work and communicating them to your supervisor. No one wants you to work 11-13 hours per day - it's not healthy and not sustainable in the long run.   There is a possibility that you are in a toxic workplace or have a bad supervisor, but you didn't really talk about that aspect so I'll assume for now that is not the case.   The most important thing is to sit with your supervisor and come up with a list of realistic expectations and be clear about how long you think each task will take. I do this with new PhD students and new postdocs each week. You can also provide regular updates for your supervisor so they know there's movement on your tasks, and modify these expectations based on new information.   Keep in mind this is not a challenge unique to academic workplaces, but also in industry.
Response 68: The answer to this varies based on where you fall in the PhD sequence, and on how rigorous your program is. It is not static. Why? Because the constraints, demands, and obligations that you deal with throughout the process are not static. I get the sense that most people responding here are either in programs with little coursework requirements or are later on in their sequences-- that is, responding from the stage at which they've already done qualifying exams and are not being forced to take a full courseload along with doing research. Post-quals/post advancement to candidacy = a generally more flexible stage that allows you to get marginally closer to a semi-normal home life. (Emphasis on ""marginally."")  &#x200B;  If we're talking about the first third or half of the PhD, my answer (coming from a very rigorous R1 program) is the following: you manage only a couple of things you've listed above, only barely, and if you're lucky. Many of them might happen only sporadically. If you have a partner living with you to help you, you might be better off. You will have very little time for these mundane things. The first few years of the PhD are like a time warp.  &#x200B;  If you're in your first few years and have a full set of graduate courses (e.g. 4 per semester, in my case) you simply don't have time. I spent my first year under such a heavy reading and workload that I was living on about 4-5 hours of sleep for the whole year; I wasn't going out, was constantly turning down hangouts with friends, had to tell people that I didn't have time to date. At all. And even then, I still wasn't getting all of the reading done. Sometimes I'd get all of my reading done but had gotten so little sleep that I couldn't always remember details immediately when being questioned on the spot...which got me accusations from my advisor of not doing the readings (yeah, I was angry. Asshole). I was pretty burnt out by the end of that year, unsurprisingly. It felt like academic hazing. And truthfully, I think it kind of was. It wasn't healthy, wasn't sustainable, wasn't reasonable or right. I could barely take care of basics like laundry (and even now, I still go a while without it sometimes, as life is still a whirlwind and I have qualifying exams in two weeks and feel way underprepared-- really hard to justify more time wasted).  &#x200B;  One thing that I realized by the end of that year is that there is truly **never** enough time, and every choice is a sacrifice. Whatever I choose to read, I'm choosing over another thing that I'm supposed to read. Whatever I choose to do is further sacrificing getting things done, no matter what. So you have to prioritize things that you'll get into tangible trouble for if you don't complete them. One example: do I wash my sheets and make my bed properly for the first time in months, or do I read and finish a paper that I need to present on in two hours? Every day, ad infinitum, because the obligations like this are just repeated every week. I realized that I had to choose explicitly to *not* complete some of my work in order to do things like go out for dinner or have any semblance of a social life, maintain basic friendships, etc. I had to cut out all extra work that I could possibly get away with not doing, and it still adds up to a lot. I'm slightly more balanced now but still find it hard to complete a lot of the things you've listed.  &#x200B;  Pro tips I've learned personally or from others over time:  * If you have the money, automated delivery services for groceries, toiletries, or ready-made meals really help. * Get used to being able to spare only 15 minutes for a quick run in the morning, at best. Often you might not be able to do so at all. * Living with or dating a normie/non-academic with an average work-life balance will make ""life maintenance"" logistics easier at home. * But at the same time, non-academics often find it hard to deal with our schedules and might become frustrated or resentful-- I'm not sure whether I'd be able to relate as well to a partner outside of academia at this point. My current partner is also an academic (with an equally terrible schedule) and I am virtually certain that this is the only reason I'm able to maintain it.
Response 69: Do not spend that much time working. You are going to be evaluated on what you produce, not the hours you spend producing it. I've seen too many grad students and postdocs think that if that light in their office is on morning to night, the adviser will appreciate all their hard work. But I've seen those students work - they go at a snail's pace. I remember painfully watching a labmate spend 4 hours putting together a conference presentation in the hotel room at the last minute. I can get one with the same quality put together in 30min. The key is to get good at what you do, and do it efficiently.

Response 71: I meal prep on the weekends, cook a ton of food.  Cleaning and laundry are on Sundays.  I'm lucky that I have a fenced yard and dog door so the dog takes herself out. Low maintenance. On my 12+ hour days I have a dog walker come.  Exercise is 3x a week about an hour each time, only strength training. Usually one session on the weekends and the others sometime in the week, usually Tuesday/Thursday or Tuesday/Friday.  Fixing the house is up to the landlord... take the car to the shop.  Maintaining relationships usually happens while studying/working/writing. I'm not close with my family. I see my partner every other day or so, depending on how busy each of us are.  Errands that need to be done during work hours I do the same as anyone else. Take time off work.  I shower when I wake up and before I go to bed. Brush teeth and do skin care around the shower. The whole routine takes 30 minutes max. On the days when I'm out of the house the hours you are, I shower/personal hygiene from 6:30 to 7 and leave the house around 7:15 to get to work/school by 8. Get home, shower at 10 and in bed by 10:30.  Time management in general: get off your computer, get off your phone, get off Reddit, don't watch TV, etc etc.

Response 73: I'm at end of my PhD, so grinding for job interviews and finishing up writing is my life right now.  In short, I eat out twice a day. Before this, I was getting a produce box delivered to my house once a week, and meal prepped. The produce box was actually significantly cheaper than my local grocery store, so it was a no-brainer. Fortunately because of job interviews, a lot of my meals are getting comped.  I do laundry a few times a week because I work out a lot, and I basically let it run while I'm working at home. The clean laundry lives in the hamper unless I'm bored and feel like folding it.
Response 74: I don’t.  I order my groceries delivered. I split with my flatnate for a cleaner every few weeks. I bulk cook and catch up with the necessary chores on weekends, have no beauty regime before being clean, and don’t get any exercise outside of my cycle to work.
Response 75: I absolutely do not work that much, and I think you would be hard pressed to find many that do. But, I do a few key things for managing normal life things while in my PhD. I do all my chores, cooking, shopping, etc. on the weekend and try to get them done as fast as possible. I cook 1 dish per week for dinner and one dish a week for lunch then eat the same food all week (not everyone loves it but it works ok for me). I do have a cat, so pretty low maintenance,  but I work at home a lot so I have plenty of time to spend with him. I go through waves where I am great at exercising regularly, other times not so much. When I’m really busy sometimes I have to let the Home stuff slide, so my apartment isn’t very clean, I don’t work out much, and I’m not cooking.

Response 82: The worst I ever had was two weeks when I slept in the lab. That was certainly not my norm - I had several months worth of 4-5 hour 'workdays', in that I only needed to be in the lab for a morning or evening. But yeah, wet lab bioscience had a lot of nasty weeks.  I couldn't have done it without:  * A supportive partner (in the same division, so we were often in the lab overnight together). * Grocery delivery services. We're in the UK, and Ocado and Sainsbury's was amazing. * Tolerance. We generally spent one day every week (or fortnight, urgh) just catching up with everything. That meant tolerating dirty sheets, piling laundry and washing up. * Cover. When we got our cat, we made sure one of us would be home at a reasonable hour every day.  Yeah, I absolutely put relationships on the back burner - but that's not uncommon for people at this age, as friends move away. A lot of my mates were busy with other work anyway, esp. medics or lawyers. Post-PhD I've successfully reconnected with a bunch of them.  With perfect hindsight, it was largely worth living that life - but I wouldn't do it again.
Response 83: Dude, people don't work that much. If some guy is on reddit saying ""I work 13 hours a day"", my response is ""the 5 hours you spend per day on reddit in your office are not work"".

Response 89: Things I did during grad school:  - Cook (Occasionally, usually in bulk to set up multiple meals)  - Shopping for groceries (Lived in an urban area, shop was a couple min walk from home, was easy to swing by the shop on my return home from work)  - Clean home, laundry (Once/week, usually Sat or Sun morning)  - Personal grooming: Thorough bath, skin care regimes (This was reduced to a bare minimum)    Things I did not do during grad school:  - Exercise: You need at least an hour and a half for exercise and recuperation  - Maintaining a pet: if you have one.  - Making repairs: Fixing your car, home, gadgets etc.  - Maintaining relationships: Like calling parents, friends to find out how they are etc.  - Caring for someone sick: If you are in that circumstance.  - Do chores that can only be done during work hours: eg going to the post office, government offices, banks, doctor's visits, mechanic's visit to your house and so on    It was a long seven years, and terrible for my mental and physical health. 2/5 would not recommend.

Response 91: I am a PhD student with 2 kids. Here is my schedule which I tweak every semester based on responsibilities.  Mon - Sat:  8: Wake up  8-10:30: family time, grooming, I skip breakfasts  10:30: Leave to work; I intentionally refer to school/lab/research as ""work"" to help me separate it from personal life.   11:30: Work starts  2: Protein shake and almonds while working  16-18: Gym or physical therapy or Skype with my family  21-22: Reply to emails, pay bills, order groceries online, have a snack, etc. or play video games for an hour.  22: Leave work, watch Netflix, listen to podcasts, or read a book while on the bus  23: dinner and meditate or just relax  Bed: 23:30   Sun: All day with my family, meal prep for the whole week (InstantPot FTW!), zero work.  This is about 45 hours of pure work a week. If I work more, I lose focus.    What really helps are various time saving tricks I have learned, e.g., doing scheduling and email during low priority but obligatory meetings or seminars, avoiding meetings when possible, blocking off time on my calendar instead of merely using a to-do list, taking care of your body to avoid losing time on being sick or injured or depressed, etc.

The whole routine takes 30 minutes max. On the days when I'm out of the house the hours you are, I shower/personal hygiene from 6:30 to 7 and leave the house around 7:15 to get to work/school by 8. Get home, shower at 10 and in bed by 10:30.  Time management in general: get off your computer, get off your phone, get off Reddit, don't watch TV, etc etc.
Response 97: Dude, people don't work that much. If some guy is on reddit saying ""I work 13 hours a day"", my response is ""the 5 hours you spend per day on reddit in your office are not work"".  If you come in for an 8-9 hour workday and you actually WORK that time, which is like take a lunch or 2 shorter breaks but spend the rest of the time doing your shit not procrastinating or doing pretend work, you will be more productive than average.

Response 102: I don’t.  I order my groceries delivered. I split with my flatnate for a cleaner every few weeks. I bulk cook and catch up with the necessary chores on weekends, have no beauty regime before being clean, and don’t get any exercise outside of my cycle to work.

Response 104: Don’t work 11-13 hrs per day. That is a terrible work environment and you will burn out and your productivity will tank. Work 8 hrs per day and free time will open up when you do that. Don’t let your PI/boss request or make you work that much. That is not normal or healthy.
Response 105: I am a PhD student with 2 kids. Here is my schedule which I tweak every semester based on responsibilities.  Mon - Sat:  8: Wake up  8-10:30: family time, grooming, I skip breakfasts  10:30: Leave to work; I intentionally refer to school/lab/research as ""work"" to help me separate it from personal life.   11:30: Work starts  2: Protein shake and almonds while working  16-18: Gym or physical therapy or Skype with my family  21-22: Reply to emails, pay bills, order groceries online, have a snack, etc. or play video games for an hour.  22: Leave work, watch Netflix, listen to podcasts, or read a book while on the bus  23: dinner and meditate or just relax  Bed: 23:30   Sun: All day with my family, meal prep for the whole week (InstantPot FTW!), zero work.  This is about 45 hours of pure work a week. If I work more, I lose focus.    What really helps are various time saving tricks I have learned, e.g., doing scheduling and email during low priority but obligatory meetings or seminars, avoiding meetings when possible, blocking off time on my calendar instead of merely using a to-do list, taking care of your body to avoid losing time on being sick or injured or depressed, etc.
Response 106: I'm at end of my PhD, so grinding for job interviews and finishing up writing is my life right now.  In short, I eat out twice a day. Before this, I was getting a produce box delivered to my house once a week, and meal prepped. The produce box was actually significantly cheaper than my local grocery store, so it was a no-brainer. Fortunately because of job interviews, a lot of my meals are getting comped.  I do laundry a few times a week because I work out a lot, and I basically let it run while I'm working at home. The clean laundry lives in the hamper unless I'm bored and feel like folding it.

Response 109: This will vary a lot based on field of study, but one thing to keep in mind is that even though PhD programs can be a lot of work, there is often going to be a fair amount of flexibility in terms of how you put your hours in, and for that matter, you should probably be taking short breaks every once in a while too.  I did my PhD in a humanities field, and while there are some things that take place on fixed schedules and locations (taking courses while you're in the coursework phase, teaching courses, holding office hours), those things are typically going to be the minority of your work time. Most of my time was occupied with things like writing, marking my students' essays, and reading/taking notes on things.  A repairman coming by the house to fix something? I'll just make sure that I have a pile of grading at home that I can work on until he shows up and while he's there. Need to stop by the bank? Use it as an opportunity to stretch your legs after you've been doing research for two hours in the library. A PhD is a lot of work, but the work is much more flexible than other types of jobs. Your schedule is more likely to be almost entirely self-motivated outside of your teaching. A lot depends on your ability to work efficiently and productively. I had a friend who did her PhD in astrophysics, and her approach was basically to work as hard and efficiently as possible from 8 to 5 every day, and my impression of her life was that she rarely did PhD work outside of those hours except from in the last semester when she was finishing everything up. It can definitely be done, but many people simply don't work efficiently.

Response 113: No I don't work 11-13 hours a day, only 7-8 hours. For sure there are certain days I have to work 12 hours at least but it's rare. For reference, I'm in a wet lab. My life is a routine, but I like it this way. This is a typical day for me:  * 730 - wake up, shower, feed the pets (I have two pet rats, they're quite self-sufficient most of the time), get a drink, prep breakfast to go * 830 - get out of house * 930 - get to school, get my first experiment set up/catch up with emails etc * 1030 - breakfast * 11 - continue doing stuff in the lab * 3 - coffee break (yea it's not a good thing, but i don't eat lunch, personal preference. but I do go out to lunch with friends occasionally, and sometimes we grab coffee at 3 when there's 1-for-1. we are cheap grad students.) * 6-7 - wind down and plan for the next day, chill/chat with others  * 730 - leave to go to the gym * 8-930 - gym + picking up stuff, food or daily necessities * 1030 - get home, eat sushi or something. No I'm not hardworking enough to meal prep, I eat discounted sushi :) * 11 - shower, get the laundry going for the smelly gym clothes; let the rats run loose while I clean their cage, play with them, watch tv at the same time * 1230 - sleep  This are my mondays, wednesdays and thursdays. Tuesdays and Thursdays I go out for dinner with friends or just head home to do nothing. On Saturdays, depending on my social calendar, I would go out in the day with friends or family or I stay home to clean, and go horseback riding in the evening. On Sundays, I go to church in the late morning, then have lunch with friends and head back to the lab to prepare for Monday. I suppose the one thing that I don't do is meal prep, which I think takes enormous amounts of time. I'm lucky that there's a lot of convenient and cheap food options even late at night.

31,"Show support for UC academic worker strike Fellow academic community-  Please take a moment to show solidarity with the academic student workers on strike at UC right now.  We are in the second week of the strike by 48,000 academic workers in the University of California (UC) system. The action is the largest strike of academic workers in United States history.  The strikers are demanding a salary increase—from an impossibly low $24,000 a year to $54,000—to address California’s skyrocketing rents and other living expenses.

I feel for the students who probably felt like they had no choice but to accept, or are first-gens without financial backing from their family.
Response 1: I keep seeing $24k cited as the current stipend, but it’s definitely much higher than that at UCs in my field- in the 30k-40k range, depending on which UC.  I’m curious as to what $24k represents? Is that the lowest paid worker currently (I know humanities fields pay a lot less)?

Response 3: Is this $24k an year, or $24k for 9-months? I gave two acquaintances at UCB (who joined PhD recently) and both mentioned they get paid around ~26 - 29k for 9 months. They're in EECS though, so that might be why

Response 7: FYI because a lot of people don't know the structure of a PhD. You can disagree with this structure but it is the current structure in the US.  A Ph.D. is a degree with some classes but is primarily working towards a final thesis documents that outlines some novel research you conducted. In theory the student has near complete control on their thesis topic, research path and what they do with their time. Being a student comes with a tuition cost and a lot research requires materials and other expensive equipment. The tuition cost drops drastically after PhD students stop taking classes (and/or progress to candidacy).  To deal with this two things are done, 1) you work closely with a PI who provides some resources and equipment but the more material support they provide the more control they have over your topic as they have to approve expenses. 2) They make you an employ for 20 hrs a week in exchange for covering your tuition (money does actually get charged to accounts for this) and pays you for those 20hrs.   Three types of employees, TA, RA, RA(thesis). The simplest type is a TA where you do work unrelated to research to pay the bills but is often only for 9 months of the year. RAs do research in a lab that is unrelated to their thesis each week for some professor (usually their PI but not always). RA(thesis) you do research in a lab but it is the same topic as your thesis. This is a double edged sword as you get to do more work towards your thesis but the line between employee and student gets very blurry.   Where does the money come from? For TA's the money for salary and tuition comes primarily from the department through fees charged on grants and tuition. For RA's the money for tuition and salary comes from the professors grants. You can think about research labs as mini business with their own accounts and expenses (some run on 50k a year and others run on millions).  This does mean the number of PhD offers made a year is tied to the cost of students and the impact this will have depends on how much funding an area has.   Where is the contention? Being a PhD student is a full time gig so even though it is only 20 hrs of employment you spend 20+ hrs being a ""student"" in addition to employment. The contention is generally do we consider this time doing research as part of a degree and treated as being a student or should it be treated as employment and become paid hours.  Both ways of looking at it have upsides and downsides:   Treating them as student gives you a lot freedom. In the first year (or two) you can focus on classes and exploring topics instead of research. You also have a very strong voice in what you want to study and your productivity during this process can be very low. The downside is you are paid half as much.   As an employee you make twice as much and being an employee comes with some protections. Workload while taking classes would increase drastically as class work would be in addition to your research in the first and second year (not possible for most students). The number of Phd positions offered would drop by about 20-40% and students would loose the ability to choose their thesis topic or perform exploration outside what is approved by the PI.   There is no better option, there are two options each with pros and cons. We've been looking at moving RAs to more hours a week post candidacy but there are complications from the federal grant side as well as questions about impact on labs in low funding areas. The UC resolution takes a third option of still calling them students but drastically increasing the pay for the 20 hrs they are counted as employees.

Response 11: FYI because a lot of people don't know the structure of a PhD. You can disagree with this structure but it is the current structure in the US.  A Ph.D. is a degree with some classes but is primarily working towards a final thesis documents that outlines some novel research you conducted. In theory the student has near complete control on their thesis topic, research path and what they do with their time. Being a student comes with a tuition cost and a lot research requires materials and other expensive equipment. The tuition cost drops drastically after PhD students stop taking classes (and/or progress to candidacy).  To deal with this two things are done, 1) you work closely with a PI who provides some resources and equipment but the more material support they provide the more control they have over your topic as they have to approve expenses. 2) They make you an employ for 20 hrs a week in exchange for covering your tuition (money does actually get charged to accounts for this) and pays you for those 20hrs.   Three types of employees, TA, RA, RA(thesis). The simplest type is a TA where you do work unrelated to research to pay the bills but is often only for 9 months of the year. RAs do research in a lab that is unrelated to their thesis each week for some professor (usually their PI but not always). RA(thesis) you do research in a lab but it is the same topic as your thesis. This is a double edged sword as you get to do more work towards your thesis but the line between employee and student gets very blurry.   Where does the money come from? For TA's the money for salary and tuition comes primarily from the department through fees charged on grants and tuition. For RA's the money for tuition and salary comes from the professors grants. You can think about research labs as mini business with their own accounts and expenses (some run on 50k a year and others run on millions).  This does mean the number of PhD offers made a year is tied to the cost of students and the impact this will have depends on how much funding an area has.   Where is the contention? Being a PhD student is a full time gig so even though it is only 20 hrs of employment you spend 20+ hrs being a ""student"" in addition to employment. The contention is generally do we consider this time doing research as part of a degree and treated as being a student or should it be treated as employment and become paid hours.  Both ways of looking at it have upsides and downsides:   Treating them as student gives you a lot freedom. In the first year (or two) you can focus on classes and exploring topics instead of research. You also have a very strong voice in what you want to study and your productivity during this process can be very low. The downside is you are paid half as much.   As an employee you make twice as much and being an employee comes with some protections. Workload while taking classes would increase drastically as class work would be in addition to your research in the first and second year (not possible for most students). The number of Phd positions offered would drop by about 20-40% and students would loose the ability to choose their thesis topic or perform exploration outside what is approved by the PI.   There is no better option, there are two options each with pros and cons. We've been looking at moving RAs to more hours a week post candidacy but there are complications from the federal grant side as well as questions about impact on labs in low funding areas.

Response 15: I was given an offer from UC Davis for their biostatistics program at just $22k flat for the academic year, to which I declined knowing it was ridiculous with that cost of living. I feel for the students who probably felt like they had no choice but to accept, or are first-gens without financial backing from their family.
Response 16: Wishing them much success! I doubt the NIH is going to match, so its up to the University to make up the difference here.   Less admin should go a long way.  I had 4 other roomates in a 3 bedroom during my PhD at a UC. Was at 17,000 per year in early 2000s. It gets old in your late 20s.

Response 19: I keep seeing $24k cited as the current stipend, but it’s definitely much higher than that at UCs in my field- in the 30k-40k range, depending on which UC.  I’m curious as to what $24k represents? Is that the lowest paid worker currently (I know humanities fields pay a lot less)?

32,"Taken a leave of absence (LOA) from my PhD and I think I’ve made a mistake.. (Very Long post, sorry!) I’ll start by saying I’m from the UK, and this is in the UK.  Back in October 2020, I started a PhD in synthetic chemistry at one of the top universities in the UK, and pretty much from the get go, it’s been turbulent. I joined during a pandemic, so I couldn’t get out much, or meet anyone, so I already felt quite alone. In regards to the PhD, it became very apparent to me that my laboratory skills were lacking. I did achieve a first class honours MChem at my last university, but it was a rather rubbish department with an awful syllabus, so my practical skills were not up to the same standard as anyone else, so I had no confidence and I felt clueless. I would feel quite crappy every day when I got home, and this meant that I did no literature reading, or general theory reading outside of the lab. My supervisor is good, he’s supportive and approachable, but there were times he would get a little exasperated if I didn’t understand something/had a list of failed reactions. In February 2021, I had to take two months off on sick for an unrelated  issue, and when I came back in April, everything has gotten worse. I’m mentally better, but I am physically exhausted all day every day, despite not overworking myself at all. I barely did a 5 day week, and no amount of sleep or rest made me feel refreshed.. on top of this, i was falling behind with a big report I had to write for my progression meeting, and almost a year in, I still haven’t read any relevant literature or general organic chemistry. So I decided to take a LOA for 6 months to figure out if there is something medically wrong with me, await my ADHD assessment (that’s another whole big thing that may explain it all), and generally catch up. Although this sounds like a good plan, I’m panicking now I’ve done this because a) I have to move hundreds of miles home due to LOA stopping your finances, so I lose the room I’m renting, b) with all the interruptions, I feel like my first year is an absolute dogs dinner, so if I return, how do I fix this? c) I’m not entirely happy with the project or city I’m in (think it’s under stimulating and boring), but I really DO want a PhD and I would be a fool to drop out/make a mess of this… I have no idea what to do, and maybe this LOA isn’t a good idea.","Response 0: Don't worry too much about not having results within one year. Most PhDs I know in chemistry (in the UK), generated good results/papers during the 3rd and 4th year. Years 1 and 2 are mostly there to allow you to learn new techniques, see what works and what doesn't, etc.  Even if you spend 3/4 years in the lab, there are still no guarantees that you will have any significant results. That is one of the realities of doing research. But even if that occurs, you will still be able to get your PhD, as long as you show in your thesis what you tried, what failed, etc (record everything!)  If you have ADHD things will be harder, but having a diagnosis & treatment will definitely help.
Response 1: I wonder if you could take a job at a lab that could increase your lab skills & confidence? That way, you could have the option of returning to your PhD in a better position than when you started. Maybe your supervisor could recommend some options.
Response 2: Hi. I think I can relate to what you're saying. I started my PhD in the US in the June of 2020. I'd just moved halfway across the world to an understimulating place (no social life of any sort) and no friends/family. The last six months have possibly been the most challenging period of my life. I developed a pretty serious drinking problem (which I think is under control now) and I couldn't get out of bed almost everyday. I've recovered pretty quickly over the last few weeks though. Although there are remnants from that shitty last year, I think it'll be gone in another few weeks.   I still have trouble getting excited about my work. It's not what I hoped to be working on, but I'm trying to stay optimistic about it. My way of convincing myself that the work I'm doing now is relevant is to try and tie it to things that do excite me.   Your leave of absence hopefully has helped you. I considered leaving for a few weeks as well, but I decided not to for various reasons. The best thing for me was getting a roommate who is passionate about his work. So bouncing ideas off of each other makes me excited about my work again and this has played a vital role in improving my life.   I made a few penpals too and that has been amazing. Just to talk about stuff and decompress.   I hope you'll be doing better soon, OP. If you think you could use a penpal, I'd be happy to exchange emails.   Have a wonderful day :)
Response 3: OP, though there are ofcourse many intricacies about your situation that only you know, this slaps me in the face as a broad mental health issue. I too did a PhD in the UK (native and still work in academia here) and had similar big doubts in my first year, almost left myself. At the time, I was constantly debating what to do, whether to take a LOA, quit altogether, change topics, all that.   Since my PhD was the main thing in my life at that point (new city, few friends etc. Sound familiar?) I naturally assumed the reason why I felt shitty all the time was because the PhD wasn't right for me (I too felt physical symptoms, and thought I had an array of physical issues, which I did not). In hindsight, it was just deflection. My mental health was a pile of shit and I just couldn't deal with the new level of independence and relative solitude I found myself in.   The PhD was never the problem, my doing poorly at it was a symptom of my lacking a philosophy for life, an error which had caught up with me. I found myself bouncing back and forth between extremes and doubting everything.   In the end, I stayed on, didn't take a significant LOA (had the odd extra week off here or there, supervisor was understanding). As time went on I worked on myself, took up meditation and stoicism. It was a long road, it's been some 8 years and I'm still not obtained God like mental health, but I'm pretty fucking solid.   Point is, if I'd of left, permanently or a LOA, I don't believe I would of ever confronted the real issues and I'd still be stumbling through life being unassured and unsatisfied. I'm not saying this is right for you, but perhaps some of my story rings a bell.
","{'solution': '{""combined_solution"": ""Taking a leave of absence (LOA) may be necessary for your mental and physical well-being, but it comes with significant implications. Here’s a structured approach to address your situation:\n\n1. **Decision to Take LOA**: \n   - Recognize that taking the LOA is a critical step for your health, given your current mental exhaustion and physical health challenges.\n   - Acknowledge potential academic risks, such as loss of momentum, but prioritize your well-being.\n\n2. **Academic Recovery Plan**:\n   - Create a structured plan to catch up on academic work post-LOA, starting with literature reading and note-taking.\n   - Collaborate with your supervisor to adjust your PhD timeline and explore remote work or project changes.\n   - Consider transferring to a different project or group if your current environment is unsatisfying.\n\n3. **Mental Health and Financial Planning**:\n   - Await the results of your ADHD assessment and implement strategies if diagnosed.\n   - Seek professional support for mental health and create a budget to address financial challenges, including potential part-time work or financial aid options.\n\n4. **Living Situation Adjustments**:\n   - Secure temporary housing, possibly with family or in a new location.\n   - Explore funding options and part-time work to stabilize your financial situation.\n\n5. **Long-Term Considerations**:\n   - Evaluate your satisfaction with your PhD project and environment.\n   - Consider discussing alternatives with your supervisor and reassess your academic fit post-LOA.\n\n6. **Phased Approach**:\n   - Approach recovery in phases, focusing first on literature, then lab work, and maintaining regular communication with your supervisor.\n   - Reconnect with peers and explore social support to enhance well-being.\n\nUltimately, the decision to take the LOA should be balanced against the need for a robust plan to ensure academic recovery and personal well-being.""}', 'atomic': False, 'depth': 0, 'original_problem': [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Taken a leave of absence (LOA) from my PhD and I think I’ve made a mistake..

Here’s a structured approach to address your situation:

1. **Decision to Take LOA**: 
   - Recognize that taking the LOA is a critical step for your health, given your current mental exhaustion and physical health challenges.
   - Acknowledge potential academic risks, such as loss of momentum, but prioritize your well-being.

2. **Academic Recovery Plan**:
   - Create a structured plan to catch up on academic work post-LOA, starting with literature reading and note-taking.
   - Collaborate with your supervisor to adjust your PhD timeline and explore remote work or project changes.
   - Consider transferring to a different project or group if your current environment is unsatisfying.

3. **Mental Health and Financial Planning**:
   - Await the results of your ADHD assessment and implement strategies if diagnosed.
   - Seek professional support for mental health and create a budget to address financial challenges, including potential part-time work or financial aid options.

4. **Living Situation Adjustments**:
   - Secure temporary housing, possibly with family or in a new location.
   - Explore funding options and part-time work to stabilize your financial situation.

5. **Long-Term Considerations**:
   - Evaluate your satisfaction with your PhD project and environment.
   - Consider discussing alternatives with your supervisor and reassess your academic fit post-LOA.

6. **Phased Approach**:
   - Approach recovery in phases, focusing first on literature, then lab work, and maintaining regular communication with your supervisor.
   - Reconnect with peers and explore social support to enhance well-being.

Ultimately, the decision to take the LOA should be balanced against the need for a robust plan to ensure academic recovery and personal well-being.""}",8.0
33,"Trying to write a paper but feeling like I have nothing of value to contribute. How to get over this? Writing my first paper ever, also my first as first author.  I did write a rough draft during the summer but then decided to add some more experiments and change the order of figures.  For the last month or so I’m sitting on the new graphs and the old draft. I just can’t bring myself to write or make figures.  I’m so scared that people will think my results are very obvious and I constantly feel that I made it so far on luck and now I have to prove that I really deserve to be here.  My boss said this is plain old imposter syndrome and it won’t go away even after I write the paper. I’ll probably think they made a mistake in accepting my paper. He says it’ll take two three papers before I firmly believe in my worth as a scientist.  That’s all fine but it does nothing to help me right now. I’m just staring at my old draft and can’t figure out how to proceed. Any advice is appreciated.","Response 0: ECR here too. Your boss is right, classic imposter syndrome. Not to discourage you, but it may never go away, so you gotta embrace it and learn how to deal with it. You'll always be in a point in your career where you know enough of your topic that you know how complicated it is, and how little you know about it. The good thing, that's not true, you probable know a lot more than what you think and you're very likely more up-to-date with the latest literature than the PIs/postdocs. Mentally, novelty always seems to be more ""interesting"" than whatever you're doing, because if you can do it, everybody can do it too, right? Well, that's not true.   So, what can you do?  1. Don't trust yourself when you have those thoughts. 2. Take a step back. Draw on a paper the steps you took and highlight important bits that inspire you to do the experiment (that goes in the intro). Now it may seem like a very linear process, but it wasn't. You just need to remember the whole process.  3. Highlight interesting parts of the methods (or why the one you chose is the best approach). Get a coffee/tea/whatever is your poison, and try to find 3 main things you thought were interesting from to your findings (what do you want to tell people about what you did?). Even if the findings won't revolutionise science, your field, or change the World as we know it, it's still important to communicate confirmatory and negative results. And in science, we do it with a paper. 4. Remember that a project is ALWAYS better when it's finished than perfect. Perfection doesn't exist and if you go after it, it'll only feed the imposter monster inside your head and make you keep working for something unatainable. Prioritise feedback rounds (get as many as you can) than your own expectation. Good supervisor/collaborators will likely know better than you what's ""enough"" to submit. 5. Break down every section to paragraphs, then write a few lines about what the topic of the paragraphs should be. As you already have a previous draft, that gives you a headstart to identify what needs to be changed.  6. When stuck, look for help. Just send it to co-authors/supervisor and ask them what they think. Ask them to be precise and suggest the changes they want to see (I hate when co-authors just add a comment that says ""change/update""). Sometimes things take way less effort than what we envisioned, which is amazing because in academia everything takes way longer than what we initially imagined.   Good luck!

Response 3: how do you know your paper have no value to contribute? even for your own self improvement in terms of writing, etc. Most good writer I know they didn't expect any values, at all. They let the readers determine that, and just let go after it publishes.
Response 4: Be kind to yourself and learn how to trust yourself.
Response 5: If you're stuck on one section, especially the introduction, switch to another. It's sometimes easier to revise a less central part of the paper, and that can help break up a block.  Regarding the imposter syndrome, so many people experience the same feelings. If you're concerned in particular about your paper having value, listen to your advisor if they say it is valuable! If you're still not sure, you have nothing to lose by submitting it for publication. You'll either get accepted, or you'll get feedback from other academics on how to make it better. Rejection is totally normal, and it doesn't mean the idea is stupid or bad, just that it wasn't totally ready yet, or maybe just that you got a bad reviewer.  But like many others are saying, also keep in mind that just because something seems obvious to you doesn't mean it's obvious to someone else! You're an expert in your project and not everyone can say that!
Response 6: I agree with what everyone else said, but on a more technical note: this is when something like the pomodoro technique can be really helpful.  Set yourself a 30 minute timer every day and work on your paper.  If you don’t get much done in that time, no worries.  If you want to keep working when the timer goes off, great! But even 30 minutes a day is better than not working on it at all, and now you won’t also be carrying around guilt because you aren’t working on your manuscript.
Response 7: Stop trying to write something valuable and just write what you know. Outline some basic questions about your topic (for the sections you still need) and then answer them. I guarantee you know more than you think you do and it's more valuable than you think it is.   And, this may be contrary to a lot of feel good advice, but stop listening to yourself. Listen to your advisor. Find a friend to read your draft and listen to them. At least for a bit. When we're ruled by our fears and anxieties, we're not a great judge of ourselves. So don't listen to yourself. Rely on others and realize you /can/ work on your paper no matter how bad you feel about it. Your fingers still work and so does your brain. And I bet it's a good brain! Good luck!

Response 10: Instead of focusing on your own work and its limitations, focus on the limitations of previous research in the field. What can you add? What ""gaps in the literature"" motivated you to start this project?  There are many good comments already here, but I don't see any that points you back to your original motivations, the gap in the literature you originally set out to address, or the weaknesses of other scholarship in your field.  It's good to look for problems in your own work because that's a measure of quality control, but that sometimes means that you forget the problems in the work of others.  I doubt you started the project thinking ""Well, the literature has all this already."" You probably started by thinking ""these publications don't go quite far enough,"" or ""I can add something to that area."" Instead of focusing on improving your own work, focus on how your work adds to, corrects, or improves on previous research, even if only in a small way.

Response 13: Write an outline. Hit each point you are trying to make with one sentence describing the point, and the result that supports it. Add a second sentence with an interpretation.   This is now your outline - each point is a paragraph. Add text in between the two sentences to explain and develop your points.   Every time I get stuck, I eventually return to this dumb, algorithmic approach. It works (for me).
Response 14: Having ""obvious"" results most likely means you had a well designed experiment and some solid data. You're not teasing apart meaning at every step, data mining to find something significant, and forcing your data into whatever narrative you want to have. Clear, concise results are like the holy grail in science.  Also, to be honest, a lot of science IS luck. We run experiments to test or examine a question, but at the end of the day we have no idea whether we're asking the right question. It's literally an educated guess. We do our best to combat this by designing experiments backed by previous literature and hold ourselves to a high standard while running those experiments. Why did my colleague get a significant reaction and I didn't? Maybe the part of the brain I'm targeting doesn't affect the behavior I'm examining, but theirs does. Literally just luck that I chose one area and they chose another.   So, sure, you might have gotten lucky, but more likely you have well designed and well executed experiment. Don't be so hard on yourself, and be proud of the work you've done!

Response 25: I've felt the same way! When I submitted my first paper, I sat on my figures/draft for quite some time before moving forward because I kept on trying to add experiments/complexity (it seemed too simplistic to me). I think I realized that this was mainly because I had been working on the experiments/paper for over a year so I was so used to everything. I think you have to narrow your focus on sharing your first draft with your advisor. At least this lessens the burden of thinking about what multiple people will think. Once you get over the hurdle of the first draft, it should be much smoother sailing
Response 26: Be kind to yourself and learn how to trust yourself.
Response 27: If you're stuck on one section, especially the introduction, switch to another. It's sometimes easier to revise a less central part of the paper, and that can help break up a block.  Regarding the imposter syndrome, so many people experience the same feelings. If you're concerned in particular about your paper having value, listen to your advisor if they say it is valuable! If you're still not sure, you have nothing to lose by submitting it for publication. You'll either get accepted, or you'll get feedback from other academics on how to make it better. Rejection is totally normal, and it doesn't mean the idea is stupid or bad, just that it wasn't totally ready yet, or maybe just that you got a bad reviewer.  But like many others are saying, also keep in mind that just because something seems obvious to you doesn't mean it's obvious to someone else! You're an expert in your project and not everyone can say that!
Response 28: I agree with what everyone else said, but on a more technical note: this is when something like the pomodoro technique can be really helpful.  Set yourself a 30 minute timer every day and work on your paper.  If you don’t get much done in that time, no worries.  If you want to keep working when the timer goes off, great! But even 30 minutes a day is better than not working on it at all, and now you won’t also be carrying around guilt because you aren’t working on your manuscript.
Response 29: Instead of focusing on your own work and its limitations, focus on the limitations of previous research in the field. What can you add? What ""gaps in the literature"" motivated you to start this project?  There are many good comments already here, but I don't see any that points you back to your original motivations, the gap in the literature you originally set out to address, or the weaknesses of other scholarship in your field.  It's good to look for problems in your own work because that's a measure of quality control, but that sometimes means that you forget the problems in the work of others.  I doubt you started the project thinking ""Well, the literature has all this already."" You probably started by thinking ""these publications don't go quite far enough,"" or ""I can add something to that area."" Instead of focusing on improving your own work, focus on how your work adds to, corrects, or improves on previous research, even if only in a small way.

Response 31: I've felt the same way! When I submitted my first paper, I sat on my figures/draft for quite some time before moving forward because I kept on trying to add experiments/complexity (it seemed too simplistic to me). I think I realized that this was mainly because I had been working on the experiments/paper for over a year so I was so used to everything.

Response 44: My first publication.   In the middle of a very positive review (recommending acceptance), my reviewer hit a paragraph towards the end of the manuscript where I did some vague speculation on what might explain the data I reported. To be honest, I was kinda stretching into a subfield I didn't really understand that well, trying to get ""theoretical"" without really having the background to pull it off. When I read that draft paragraph now I seriously cringe.  Anyway, in the middle of this really positive review, suddenly the reviewer says ""this paragraph makes absolutely no sense, it's frankly embarrassing, and it should be removed."" Just fucking brutal. Once I recovered from the shock, I realized they were right, and I did exactly what they suggested. Ended up getting published in that journal.  Fast forward 8 years: I know exactly who that reviewer was (*very* senior person in my field who I admire a ton), they've supported my career ever since, and we're also good friends.

Response 52: Reviewer (for top 3 journal in my field): manuscript would be much better if they had a general theorem rather than only specific examples.   Manuscript: Section 4.

I got my first peer review requests last year, around the time of my PhD defense. In the first year of my postdoc, I was getting requests maybe once a month on average. Just starting my second year, and I've been getting almost one a week now.","Response 0: It probably depends on your field. In mine, I did not get my first official peer review request from a journal until my first year as a tenure-track PI. After 5 years I was getting 10/year. After 10 years as a PI I was getting 20-25 per year. Now I get about 50-100 requests per year, but I only do 20-24. The general guideline is to do about 2-3 reviews for every manuscript you submit.
Response 1: I started getting them after I published, from that journal specifically.
Response 2: I started getting them after I published, from that journal specifically.
Response 3: These requests increase dramatically when you publish and the more you publish the more requests you will get.
Response 4: These requests increase dramatically when you publish and the more you publish the more requests you will get.
Response 5: I started getting them after I published, from that journal specifically.
Response 6: I started getting them after I published, from that journal specifically.
Response 7: I did some co-reviewing with my Ph.D. supervisor early on in my Ph.D.; after that, he started occasionally suggesting me as a reviewer on requests he turned down. Was a trickle at first; now I'm in the second year of my postdoc and get 3-4 requests a month. Some of it has little to do with my expertise; I'd say only about a quarter or so really are exactly in my area.   I try to do about 1-2 reviews each month while prioritising reviewing for diamond open access journals (or other journals I find worth supporting) and submissions by researchers from the global south.
Response 8: It depends on the field. In one of my fields, as long as you are in the submission system of a journal or conference, you are in the list of reviewers and it usually does not take long to get a review request. So, basically I started being a reviewer at the beginning of my PhD.   You do not have to accept every request. Sometimes I do because I am intrigued by the paper. but most of the time it is because I am interested. You learn a lot while reviewing. It is a pain at the beginning but it gets easier over time, like for writing papers. You learn new results before they get published (while you are not allowed to use them before that, you can still think about them), you learn to see how papers can be improved, and you develop a critical eye on results/approaches/theories. All of that is useful for your future research and for writing your next papers.  I used to review a lot for many different journals and conferences. Now, I am only accepting requests in journals where I am publishing in or where I am intending to publish in. The number of review requests have exploded over the recent years due to the proliferation of predatory journals. I do not have time for that and the quality of the papers is very often not worth the time I will spend of them.
Response 9: I’ve consistently gotten a few per year since publishing in a very specific field. I only have a formal Bachelor’s, although I’d like to pursue a PhD, in the very unlikely circumstance that external complicating factors resolve.
Response 10: 2nd year of my phd! get a request every few months. fifth year currently.
Response 11: What I noticed that simply publishing didn't get me PR requests - it was once I started receiving regular citations that they started to come in. A trickle to begin, one or two a year perhaps. Then more. Then lots.  That being said, I'd suppose it depends on where one is within their field rather than arbitrary markers in specific departments. An editorial board neither really knows nor cares about things like comps or departmental progress, all they want to know is if the person has specific expertise and can comment with a high degree of mastery on a certain topic. For most people that starts after a PhD, for many it will be in their masters or early PhD. Perhaps a few people would make it into a postdoc without having being asked. All depends on the quality, significance, general reputation of what their important (ie: well-regarded publication in a well-regarded journal) contributions have been. And, as in all things in this world, it's very field dependant, so this is going to vary a bit.  The other thing is that there's a lot of publishing and not nearly enough qualified academics to do PR. This is actually a major crisis, and one of the many reasons why quality of publications have been really falling. Too many publications and not enough adjudicators. It also means the more junior folks are getting press ganged into service earlier. This is both a good and a bad thing.

Response 14: If you are still a student and you are getting too many, you should turn them down. One or two per month is manageable but any more than that may be too much especially if it gets in the way of getting what you want: a job.

Response 18: I got my first one in my final PhD year.  I would get a few a year as a postdoc.  I still get about one every two months.  I don't reject a lot of them, I figure senior people like I am should try to pick up the slack so younger people can concentrate on other stuff.
Response 19: I've never had requests with that frequency. I get a gentle trickle throughout the year, mainly from one journal where I know one of the sub-editors and he sends me anything vaguely connected to my field of expertise.  Last year I did the Elsevier peer review online course, which I found very useful. Just mentioning that because peer review was just something I fell into unprepared a few years ago, so having some sort of training was necessary.

Response 1: Likely no one specific reason. However, in my opinion, a big factor is that said graduates are working at a business which produces goods that people pay money for. That is not often the case for researchers. For example, the goods researchers produce are often free for others (e.g., open source software, so that uptake is greater), or aren't fundamentally made to turn a profit (e.g., a paper).

Response 7: Despite what people like to think, nobody is paid based on how smart they are or how much work they put in. They are paid based on 2 things:  - The amount of money they make for the person paying them  - The amount it costs to replace them (demand vs supply)  When academics produce very little that makes money, and are easily replaced due to the massive supply of other PhDs pining after the academic jobs with no self-respect, willing to be paid the bare minimum to survive, they will be paid very little.

39,"Would it be appropriate to thank my therapist in my MA thesis acknowledgements? My therapist has a background in my field, before they switched to psychology, and has been an amazing sounding board for some of my ideas over the past couple years. They've genuinely helped me to recontextualize some ideas and open up new doors I hadn't considered before in my research, and given some great advice on how to keep my enthusiasm for my topic going. That's on top of the more typical stuff like helping me to manage my impostor syndrome and ADHD. Basically I wouldn't even be in grad school without them and I'd like to be able to thank them in my MA thesis' acknowledgements section (once I finish the damn thing... getting there). Just by name alongside friends and colleagues, not necessarily giving details on who they are.  I'm quite open about being in therapy and not concerned about people knowing, but more worried that it would be inappropriate in the therapist-patient relationship, or that it might have repercussions for me or them that I haven't forseen. Anyone have experience with this?","Response 0: Why not?  In my PhD dissertation  I acknowledged my dog ""for helping me stay sane"".  Nobody blinked.
Response 1: It’s your thesis. I say thank anyone you want. Maybe ask them if they’d be ok with you thanking them or maybe just don’t use their name.  I honestly think other students and professors could benefit by it. Knowing that other people are in therapy and benefiting and succeeding would be nice. I never wanted to talk about being in therapy in grad school because I didn’t want anyone to think I couldn’t make it through. Seeing someone succeed and being empowered by it would have helped me.
Response 2: Sure it is! The acknowledgements section is for you to thank anybody whom you feel helped you during your MsC. If you are not sure your therapist would appreciate, maybe ask them?
Response 3: I have seen people thank all kinds of entities and relationships in their acknowledgments. It's impossible to predict how others may react to reading this in your acknowledgments. Maybe worth asking the therapist if they are okay with it if you are concerned, but otherwise my view is acknowledge anyone and anything you like.
Response 4: Are you forced to tell that person is your therapist in the thesis ? Just thank him/her by name, without naming the profession (that's what I did in mine). And ask the person first, of course !

Response 7: I thanked the 1993 Montréal Canadiens for winning the Stanley Cup in my PhD dissertation (which led to a funny story, but that's neither here nor there).  Seriously, thank anyone you'd like.  It's the one place in your thesis you can be you.

Response 9: My partner thanked me in their thesis for being their emotional bedrock, but also because whenever they were stuck with writing I'd ask them to explain everything to me like I was a rubber duck. If you're worried, keep the acknowledgement somewhat vague and focus on sounding neurotypical, but I don't think most people read the acknowledgements carefully anyway.
Response 10: Yes. The acknowledgments section is truly entirely yours. You can thank whoever you want. You might want to check with the therapist that they're ok with it. As long as they are go for it.
Response 11: Sure it is! The acknowledgements section is for you to thank anybody whom you feel helped you during your MsC. If you are not sure your therapist would appreciate, maybe ask them?
Response 12: I would urge caution over speficically talking about your therapy. Backlash can come from unexpected sources and at the worst of times. (Or so I've heard.)  FWIW, I would write an acknowledgement of their contribution that was coded in such a way that those who are hostile to the concept of mental wellness would miss.  Something along the lines of *they* ***guided*** *me through many of the difficult obstacles of preparing this thesis*... and/or ***my working alliance*** *with them enabled me to complete this thesis.* Or, *on almost a weekly basis, they* ***listened*** *to my many concerns and* ***talked*** *me through many challenges*.  Addintionally, if you and your therapist devleoped words/phrases to represent larger dynamics/issues/approaches, you could use one. *This thesis required a tremendous amount of* ***heavy lifting****. They helped me to shoulder the load.*  (The bold type is just to highlight the code words/phrases that could potentially resonate.)
Response 13: Yes. The acknowledgments section is truly entirely yours. You can thank whoever you want. You might want to check with the therapist that they're ok with it. As long as they are go for it.
Response 14: I acknowledged my cat in my PhD, it’s your thesis so do what you want.
Response 15: You can thank anyone or anything.  People thank their dog or coffee. You are right that there could be some negative perceptions. This shouldn't be, but it is.
Response 16: I thanked the security guard that did the rounds late at night for the chats, snacks and company (Sometimes he stayed for hours talking). I also gave him a copy of my thesis. I didn’t mention he was a security guy (why would I?). If you are worried about getting your therapist in trouble do the same.

Response 29: Based on my experience with therapists and my understanding of professional ethics in health care fields, there's nothing risky or unprofessional about you acknowledging them - and it sounds like it's important to you to do so.  Unlike some others here, I would encourage you to bring it up with your therapist. Firstly because your professional relationship with your therapist is in-bounds for therapy. Secondly,  they're human, too: they may really appreciate the acknowledgement. If there's a reason they don't want you to put it in writing, at least they'll know that you recognize their support.

I listed the friends in my thesis reading group, and the many friends who listened to me rant about my topic over endless pints of beer for almost 7 years, so have at it.

Response 34: I acknowledged my cat in my PhD, it’s your thesis so do what you want.
Response 35: Omg I actually have the answer for this!  I asked my therapist for permission. He was so surprised and honoured. I asked him if he’d prefer his name or just be referred to as “my therapist” and he told me he preferred the anonymity, but still felt it meant a lot. It means a lot to both of us, and I was glad to get his consent and preference

I will not name the company, but it's one of the better-known ones that provide this service. I fell into this job during grad school when I was desperately poor and it's been so disillusioning knowing that stupid, lazy people can essentially just purchase college degrees.  I hate my clients passionately. They are lazy, demanding, ignorant morons who often cannot even succeed in copying and pasting their assignment instructions from the syllabus. They aren't supposed to submit any identifying information, but because they're stupid and lazy, of course tons of them do, so I know their name, their professor's name, their university, etc. My question is, how would you respond if you got an anonymous email that basically said, ""Student So and So has acquired the services of \[company\] to cheat on their paper, just wanted to let you know.""  I would probably be immediately fired if I ever did it, but my God do I want to. It's not just undergraduates, either. It's grad students, professional students...students in medical fields.

Response 19: That actually happened to one of my friends in grad school - he was teaching an undergrad class, and one of the undergrads cheated on his homework and then refused to pay the person who did his homework for him. The person who did the homework contacted the university to out the student, and we failed him. Put us in a bit of an awkward position though, as the person helping him cheat was a grad student at a nearby university and working for this company was definitely a violation of the honor code there. We didn't report him, though.

Response 22: It depends on the field. In CS/AI, where I am based, people tend to read pop-sci books and use scholarly books as references in courses or for their own research (but not read cover-to-cover). In philosophy, books are the norm.  I personally don't have time to read scholarly books (unless when doing a paid review), but I still purchase and refer to them by cherry-picking which chapters to read out of them.
Response 23: Basically, I’ll pick up a book if it’s written by someone I know personally. Maybe buy if it’s halfway related to my research or interesting, library if it’s someone I like but the subject is outside my wheelhouse.

Response 25: Psych grad student here. I spend a LOT of time listening to audiobooks, so any academic source that is written well enough and engaging enough to be read as an audiobook gets put in the queue for when I have a free Audible credit. I listen to podcasts, especially Opening Arguments, which is a podcast that functions as a bi-weekly researched and loosely cited Law Review article, which is essentially a kind of literature review. Another source I rely on pretty heavily is LeftTube, or the leftist segment of YouTube, not for ideological talking points but for critical analysis and a good mix of cross-disciplinary thought pieces that are usually cited fairly well.  The real problem in my field of psychology is that the insular nature of the research and the pressure to publish means that most of the articles out there are kind of shit. They either exist in a discourse that is so insular it might as well be useless, or are so hopelessly broad and presented with so little context that even though significant results exist they don’t ACTUALLY prove anything.  Personally I’ve found that until I’ve developed a critically informed take on specific psychological topics reading articles of any kind about the topic has been useless.

Response 3: Have you considered more applied statistics? Things like the Institute of Disease Modelling might appeal: they're a research institute (of sorts), with opportunity to publish but less demand to do so than in a standard academic job.
